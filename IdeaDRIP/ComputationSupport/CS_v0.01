 #1 - Knowledge Integration
 --------------------------
 --------------------------
 1.1) Synthesizing multiple knowledge models/representations into a common model/representation.
 1.2) Information Integration - merges information with different schemas and representations
 1.3) Knowledge integration focuses on synthesizing the understanding from different perspectives
 1.4) Knowledge integration -> also the process of incorporating new information into existing knowledge
	- Determining how the new information and the existing knowledge interact
	- How existing knowledge should be modified to accommodate the new information
	- How the new information should be modified in light of the existing knowledge
 1.5) Learning agent investigates detecting and exploiting learning opportunities
	- Resolve conflicts and fills gaps
	- Uses automated/semi-automated integration for constructing the knowledge base
 1.6) Minimal Mapping:
	- Minimize the effort in mapping validation and visualization
	- High quality mappings that:
		- Other mappings computed from them in time linear in input graphs size, and
		- None of them dropped without losing above property
