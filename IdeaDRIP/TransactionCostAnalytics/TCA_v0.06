 #3 - Trading Strategy Algo Framework
 --------------------------
 --------------------------
 3.1) Broad Institutional Trading Platform Components
	- Algo Engine
	- FIX Translator
	- Order Validator
	- Risk Management
	- Monitoring
	- Market Data Consumer
	- Post-trade Processor
 3.2) Algo Engine
	- Purpose: Takes the client’s high-level instruction, and decides how and when to slice out child orders
		based on the current state of the market and the pre-loaded quantitative models
	- Core Functional Components
		- Algo Model Data Interface
		- Order Validation Engine
		- Child Order Slicing Interface
		- OMS Venue Interface
		- Market Data Interfacer
		- Security Master Static Data Interface
		- Algo Output Safety Bounds Checker
		- Risk Check Interface
		- Strategy Implementer (e.g., VWAP, DROP LIQUIDITY SEEKER)
		- Timer Service Interface
 3.3) The Trading Strategies (Algos)
	- VWAP - Strategy trades in line with the market volume based on a dynamic volume prediction model
	- DROP LIQUIDITY SEEKER - Hybrid liquidity seeker/impact minimization algo that balances the speed of
		execution with avoiding undue market impact as per its equivalent model, with an opportunistic
		component searching for block liquidity in parallel
	- Safety Customizations - Order must a) complete, b) exclude auctions
 3.4) Trading Logic Components
	- Algo, Scheduler, Order Task, Order Router
	- Algo:
		- Top layer that manages all upstream interactions with the user, e.g., handling new orders and
			amendments, and it creates and manages the Scheduler and the Order Task
		- Responsible for slicing child shares to the opening and the closing auctions
	- Scheduler:
		- Paces the order over the duration using the various quantitative models and the trading logic
		- Pre-trade Scheduler: Suggests the total number of shares to trade over the duration of the order.
		- Impact Minimization Scheduler: Pace at which the Algo should trade at any given time. This is used
			for DROP LIQUIDITY SEEKER orders
		- VWAP Scheduler: Predicts the amount of volume throughout the day and at the auctions based on what
			has happened historically and intra-day so far
	- Order Task and Order Router:
		- Order Task: Manages and deploys three layers of intra-day trading tactics, i.e., routers, and
			shuffles between them as dictated by the Algo
		- Order Router: Router can also stitch together multiple sub-routers, for example a serial mid-point
			all-or-none router + a spread crossing order to the IEX router
		- POST – Passively adding liquidity
			- Starts with a 2:1 split-post on the near-side between IEX D-Limit and the primary exchange
			- Proportionately reshuffles between two legs based on where it gets filled, and re-pegs to the
				inside roughly every 30-60 seconds if the stock drifts away
		- TAKE – immediately removing liquidity
			- First serially pings a handful of dark-pools using all-or-none IOCs, and if that fails, it
				crosses the spread to remove liquidity using the IEX router
		- OPPO – opportunistically seeking block liquidity
			- Searches for block liquidity by split-posting mid-point orders across several dark pools and
				exchanges using a high minimum quantity, generally in the thousands of shares. This may be
				supplemented with other order types such as conditionals
 3.5) Order Lifecyle:
	- Order Arrival:
		- Receipt of a valid order, Algo subscribes to market data and then creates the Scheduler
		- For a VWAP order, the Algo creates VWAP scheduler; for a DROP LIQUIDITY SEEKER order, it creates an
			Impact Minimization Scheduler
		- Then, the Algo registers with the Algo Engine for various wakeup callbacks; at the start time,
			shortly before auction cutoff times, at the cleanup time, i.e., shortly before the end, and at
			the end time
	- Order Wakeups:
		- Upon a Pre-auction Wakeup, the Algo slices shares to the primary auction
		- At the Start Time, the Algo creates the worker and begins the first interval – the Interval logic
		- Upon the Cleanup wakeup, the Algo tells the Worker to complete any remaining scheduled shares
		- Upon the End Time Wakeup, the Algo cancels any outstanding orders and then provides an out to the
			user
	- Order Intervals:
		- Life of an order as a series of distinct 5-10 “intervals”
		- Scheduler Input #1 - Interval Length
			- Length of the interval is used to request a wakeup at the end
			- Interval length depend on other factors too like the time of the day – intervals are stretched
				longer in the morning when spreads are wider, and compressed as the day progresses
			- Additionally, smaller orders have longer intervals and vice versa. All interval durations are
				randomized
		- Scheduler Input #2 - Number of Shares Scheduled
			- VWAP Scheduler uses the dynamic volume prediction model to predict what percentage of the day’s
				volume will have traded by the end of the current interval
			- Impact Minimization Scheduler gets this value by running a dynamic programming cycle of the
				impact minimization model
			- Algo then uses this information to tell the Order Task to complete any shares outstanding from
				previous interval and start working a new interval quantity
			- Additionally, the Algo requests “catch up” wakeups throughout the interval where it checks if
				the Order Task is falling behind, and if so, tells it to cross the spread to keep up pace
			- Throughout the life of a DROP LIQUIDITY SEEKER order, the Algo tells the Order Task to search
				for block liquidity at the mid-point with all remaining unscheduled shares using an
				Opportunistic router
	- Order Amendment:
		- Upon receipt of a client replace request, the Algo generally cancels or amends the Order Task to
			comply with the new instructions
		- Algo also creates a new Scheduler to use from this point forward
 3.6) Trading Objectives/Design Process
	- Low Level:
		- Objective #1 - Avoiding Adverse Selection
			- Prop Firm Perspective - When the market transitions to a new price level, there is a flood of
				trading activity where the fastest proprietary firms race to pick off the resting orders at
				the old price level and establish queue position at the new price level – these are two
				similar but different strategies
			- Sell-side Perspective - As a sell-side firm, it is not plausible to effectively compete in
				these races, so the only viable way to prevent adverse selection is to utilize built-in
				protections available in trading venues, such as IEX D-Peg and D-Limit, and NASDAQ MELO
		- Objective #2 - Removing Liquidity
			- Algo starts off by using the IEX Router when crossing the spread
			- Dark pools are checked using the all-or-none mid-point order prior to crossing the spread
	- High Level:
		- Objective: Optimize Factors that determine how the Algo should spread out trading throughout the
			day
		- Factor #1: How does one measure success at a high level? Using Distilled Impact
		- Factor #2: How much volume does one expect to trade during the life of the order? Volume Prediction
			Model
		- Factor #3: How much should the Algo be willing to trade during the life of the order? Pre-trade
			Model
		- Factor #4: How should one pace the trading activity throughout the life of the order? Impact
			Minimization Model
 --------------------------
 #4 - Volume-Weighted Average Approach
 --------------------------
 --------------------------
 4.1) General Hstorical Market Symbol Cumulative Volume to Time t vs. Realized Symbol Volume at Time t
	- Of course, and their VWAP
 4.2) Problem Formulation
	- Daily Time Interval (09:30 to 16:00) divv'ied into delta t = 10 minute intervals
	- Opening Auction Volume is up to 09:30
	- Closing Auction Volume is after 16:00 (say 16:10)
	- Historical Time-wise Average Volume V_hist and Traded Percentage X_hist (based on rolling delta d = 20 day average)
	- Historical Time-wise 20 day ADV
	- Realized Time-wise Average Volume V_realized and Traded Percentage X_realized
	- Decision to catch up or wait or do nothing
		- If catch up, how much
		- It wait, how long
		- Do nothing - if the catch up market impact is too high
	- Volume Prediction mismatch Metric
		- |Historical(t) - Realized(t)| Integrand
 4.3) Estimation of Predicted Volume Fraction R(t)
	- ADV Normalized Trading Volume A(t) = V(t)/ADV
	- Observations Grouped by V_hist(t) and A(t)
	- Predicted Volume Fraction R(t) is the average of X_hist(t) across a single grouping of V_hist(t) and A(t)
 4.4) Partial Trading Days
	- Need estimates for volume fraction start and volume fraction end times
	- Smooth, monotonic interpolation

 --------------------------
 6.1) Algos - NAGAR; Venue - VIPANI; Router - PATH
 6.2) Components - Scheduler, Order Placement, Router
	- Order Placement invokes the Router using the Execution Modes
 6.3) Execution Modes - Ping, Sweep, Exchange Post, Dark Post
	- On Marketability - Follow Ping, Sweep, Exchange Post in that order
	- Dark Post exclusive to the other modes
 6.4) Ping Execution Mode
	- Locate Hidden Liquidity within bid-ask Spread
	- Remove Displayed Liquidity at:
		- Far-touch => NBO for buy, NBB for sell
		- Near-touch or better => at/above NBB for buy, at/below NBO for sell
	- Dynamic Ping - uses mid-point and limit IOC on a custom venue set (across Exchange/ATS/IOI Venues)
 6.5) Sweep Execution Mode
	- Take Liquidity at best displayed price/better
	- Liquidity displayed at a Custom venue set (across Exchange/ATS/IOI Venues)
	- Use ISO IOC orders
	- Sweep multiple price levels simultaneously
	- Limit price based on depth needed for order fill, overridden only by more conservative client limit price
 6.5) Exchange Post Execution Mode
	- Provide Liquidity for Unmarketable Orders
	- Smart Exchange Post - uses probability of fill in conjunction with price impact on chosen venue
		- May allocate to both displayed and non-displayed liquidity
		- Same venue for both displayed and non-displayed liquidity - results in a single reserve order
	- Dynamic Exchange Post - uses profiles based posting based on venue market share/allocation weights
	- Always uses non-routable DAY limit displayed orders when posting
		- If the non-routable post locks/crosses NBBO, exchange slides the displayed price to a valid increment
	- Re-allocation among Venues when:
		- Child order receives a full fill
		- Minimum Time Elapsed
		- Market Conditions have Changed
	- When locked/crossed, trigger Ping/Sweep to take liquidity
	- Just before opening/closing, reallocate to primary exchange to ensure resting orders participate in auctions
 6.6) Dark Post Execution Mode
	- Provide Hidden Liquidity for Unmarketable Orders
	- Uses Smart Dark Post and Dynamic Dark Post
	- Posts are typically mid-point DAY, overriden by passive or market-peg on client instructions
	- Re-allocation among Venues when:
		- Child order receives a full fill
		- Minimum Time Elapsed
		- Market Conditions have Changed
	- NAGAR posts internally to VIPANI for short time to allow for internal crossing
 6.6) Real-time Venue Selection Criteria:

	- Best price venue down - sent to default venue (e.g. BATS)
