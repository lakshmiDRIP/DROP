 --------------------------
 #1 - Exchange Order (COMPLETED)
 --------------------------
 1.1) Market Order
	- Immediate Execution at Current Prices - Lowest Commissions/Fees
 1.2) Limit Order
	- Orders with least acceptable price - execution should be at a better price
		- Execution Uncertainty, i.e., may not be "marketable"
	- Buy Limit/Sell Limit Orders
	- FOK - either filled completely on the first attempt or canceled outright
	- AON - must be filled with the entire number of shares specified, or not at all. If not filled, posted on the order book
 1.3) Time-in-Force
	- Closing Time: Equities - specified by exchange; FX - 5 PM EST except for NZD
	- DAY/GFD: Order valid till close
	- GTC: Order valid until Cancel - some brokers may limit it to, say, 90 days
	- IOC: Immediate execution or cancel - allows for partial fill (unlike FOK)
	- Single Price Open/Close Auctions - some exchanges also have before/after lunch auctions
	- At the open/close - orders must be in 20 min or so prior
	- MOC/MOO/LOC/LOO
	- Reg NMS IOC orders can be re-routed on sweep
 1.4) Conditional - Executed when conditions are met (not just price, which is limit order)
	- Conditional Stop Order:
		- Execute once market price (mid?) reaches the stop level. Upon reaching that, order becomes market order, so no price certainty.
		- Buy Stop and Sell Stop
		- Execution price may be different from the stop limit
		- Used in exchanges more than in OTC
		- Stop Limit Order - Sets a limit price, so price certainty, less execution certainty.
		- Trailing Stop Order - contains a stop parameter that creates a moving or trailing activation price
			- E.g., 10% below current market price
			- Trailing parameter base refresh frequency, i.e., determination of when is current
		- Trailing Stop-Limit Order - Trailing Stop + a limit price
	- Conditional Peg Orders
		- Market Maker Behavior. Uses a "stepper" logic.
		- Peg Best:
			- Like a real market maker, the stepper:
				- Uses the other side of the spread
				- Always jumps over the competitors order to be the best one, the first in the line
				- No-step over conditions are:
					- Price limitation, no more jumping over, unless the price moves back to its area
					- Step Value
			- Peg Mid-price - Limit price is average of BBO National or local
				- Popular in ATS and Dark pool, participants pay half of spread
	- Market-if-touched - Market Order if market price "touches" specified level
		- Buy/Sell variants
	- One cancels other
	- One sends other
	- Tick-sensitive Orders - e.g., buy on downtick. Short sell orders are tick-sensitive
	- At-the-opening: If not executable, cancel it
 1.5) Discretionary - Delayed by broker for a better price - augments other types - also referred as not-held
 1.6) Bracket - Market a Pair of two orders, e.g., lock profit and floor losses
 1.7) Quantity and display instructions - Display Instructions can be customized. Icebaer'g only diplay partially
	- E.g., AON to display if there is a fill
 1.8) Electronic Markets Order Priority
	- Market > Limit > ...
	- Simplest Limit highest priority
	- Conditional priority when met first-come
	- Iceberg/Dark-Pool Undisplayed Liquidity Least Priority

 --------------------------
 4.1) RFQ vs. Order Book
 --------------------------

 --------------------------
 #5 - Limit Order Book Simulations: A Review
 --------------------------
 --------------------------
 5.1) Limit Order Book Dynamics
	- Buy Section vs. Sell Section
		- Levels separated by one tick
		- Best Bid vs Best Ask and Spread/Mid
	- Levels based on Price
		- Orders at each Level (orders have quantity)
		- Aggregate Level Quantity
	- Order Categories - Limit/Market/Cancel
		- Market Order - drains liquidity at the corresponding side
		- Limit Order - post liquidity
		- Cancel Order - remove posted liquidity
 5.2) Order Book Dynamics S_t
	- Order Book State Dependence at Level x:
		- Best Bid/Ask Price
		- Bid/Ask Volumes at x
	- Order Book Events:
		- Market Orders Bid/Ask - A/E
		- In-spread Limit Orders Bid/Ask - B/F
		- Cancel Orders Bid/Ask - C/G
		- Not In-spread Limit Orders Bid/Ask - D/H
	- Order Book Evolution: S_t+1 = S_t + D_t(S_t)
	- Dynamics Induced:
		- Market Order Buy/Sell Queue-clearing - one/more tick moves up/down
		- Market Order Buy/Sell Non-Queue-clearing - changes volume not prices
 5.3) Stylized Facts:
	- Cont (2011):
		- Price changes anti-correlated at small time lags, uncorrelated at longer lags
		- Trading Volumes are heterogenous and strongly auto-correlated
		- Trading volumes show strong intra-day seasonality
		- Order durations are auto-correlated; positive correlation across order types
	- Vyetrenko et. al. (2020):
		- Empiricial Distributions of: Densities of price/returns/order volumes/arrival rates/time-to-fills
			- Joint densities of bid/ask queue sizes
			- Long-tailed Distirbution of Returns
		- Auto-correlation of returns - vanishes with delta t
			- Auto-correlation of squared returns - measures "Volatility Clustering"
		- Volatility and Volume positively correlated; Volatility and Returns negatively correlated
		- U shaped Volume Profile
		- Signature Plots: Relation between Volatility and Sampling Frequency. This decays slowly
		- Average Book Shape: M shape for average shape of high-spread stocks and inverted V shape for low spread stocks
		- Prce Paths comparison to empirical
 5.4) Point Processes Models
	- Arrival Process Associated with a Counting Process
		- Counting Process - number that arrive in an increment
		- lambda - Incremental Probability that the Number is > 0 divided by that increment
 5.5) Point Processes Models - Poisson Process as 'Zero-Intelligence'
 5.6) Point Processes Models - Variable Order Intensity Process
	- Non-constant Order Intensity
	- Hult and Kiessling (2010):
		- Limit/Cancel intensities dependent on distance from mid-price; Market Intensities Constant
			- Stationary Exponential Order Size Distribution
			- Markov Chain LOB Model + optimal trading strategies
	- Huang, Lehalle, and Rosenbaum (2015):
		- Different Bid/ask Queue Models around a fixed reference price
		- Queue-reactive Model: Arrival Rates depend on current queue size, bid/ask queue processes independent
	- Lu and Abergel (2018b):
		- Augment Huang, Lehalle, and Rosenbaum (2015) using non-Markovian order flow dynamic
			- Intensities depend on order flow history
		- Limit Order sizes follow geometric distribution
		- Cancel order sizes follow truncated geometric distributions
		- Market order sizes - a mixture of geometric and Delta for units of 50
		- History dependence on new limit orders' on cleared queues
 5.7) Point Processes Models - Poisson Process do not model corelation between order arrivals
 5.8) Point Processes Models - Hawkes Process Advantages
	- Volatility Clustering
	- Epps Effect - Zeroing of Price covariance at small timescales
 5.9) Point Processes Models - Hawkes Process Mathematical Overview
	- 2D Example: Excitations ask->ask, ask->bid, bid->ask, bid->bid
	- Sample Dimensions: bid/ask, Limit/Market/Cancel
	- Dimensions correspond to excitation events, not necessary order arrival events
	- Mu (i, t) - Endogenous Excitation Intensity for dimension i
	- Phi (j->i, t) - Excitation by dimension j on dimension i at time t
	- Lambda (i, t) = Mu (i, t) + Sum over dimensions {Sum over t_j <= t [Phi (j->i, t)]}
	- Continuous Versions of the Same:
		- Lambda (i, t) = Mu (i, t) + Sum over dimensions {Integral s over (0, t) of [Phi (j->i, t-s) delta N(j, s)]}
	- Excitation Kernel Choice: Power law better than Exponential
 5.10) Point Processes Models - Multi-dimensional Hawkes Process
	- Toke (2010) Model 1:
		- 2D Hawkes - on each for Market (Liquidity Taker) and Limit (Liquidity Provider); Cancels are Poisson
		- Pre-set Price Distribution for Limit/Cancel
	- Toke (2010) Model 2:
		- Self-exciting Limit/Market + Market exciting Future Limit
	- 8-dimensional Bacry, Jaisson, and Muzy (2016)
		- Dimension #1 - Orders changing Mid-price
		- Dimension #2-4 - Market/Limit/Cancel don't change mid
		- Bid/Ask - total 4x2=8
	- 10D Large (2007)
		- Dimension Categories 4 - Limit/Market, Mid-price Change/Don't
		- Dimension #5 - Cancel
		- Bid/Ask - total 5x2=10
		- Order Book Resiliency - ability to replenish after a big depletion
	- Kirchner (2017) - Non-parametric Hawkes Estimation with AIC
	- da Fonseca and Zaatour (2014): 4 Moment-matching Hawkes fit: faster than MLE, but weaker true parameter convergence
	- Zheng, Roueff, and Abergel (2014):
		- 4D bid/ask cross-excitation Hawkes + spread process to control bid > ask
	- Lee and Seo (2022):
		- 4D bid/ask cross-excitation Hawkes + exogenous spread-narrowing process a function of spread reltive to price
			- Consequence: AT 1-tick width, exogenous spread-narrowing width is zero
		- Spread-dependent + stochastic decay kernels
 5.11) Point Processes Models - Other Hawkes Process Variants
	- Kaj and Caglar (2017) - also called Buffer Hawkes:
		- Market Orders -> queue-reactive Poisson arrivals
		- Limit Orders -> Hawkes with excitation from Market Orders
		- Cancels -> Constant Intensity Poisson arrivals
	- Morariu-Patrichi and Pakkanen (2022):
		- State-dependent Excitation #1 - Triggered when the spread is 1-tick
		- State-dependent Excitation #2 - Triggered by order-flow imbalance
	- Kirchner and Vetter (2022):
		- State-dependent Excitation - Triggered by order-flow imbalance
	- Mucciante and Sancetta (2023):
		- State-dependent Excitation - Intensity == Hawkes times a Linear function on market observables
			- Automatically allow the intensity to follow intraday profile
	- Wu, Rambaldi, Muzy, and Bacry (2019):
		- Comparison of Queue-reactive Hawkes against a scaled Queue-reactive Hawkes
	- Rambaldi, Bacry, and Lillo (2017):
		- State-dependent Excitation - Triggered by order-size and order count
		- State-dependency using Marked Hawkes - marks corresponds to various bins of order sizes
 5.12) Limit Order Book Simulations: A Review - Hawkes Process Scaling Limits:
	- Abergel and Jedidi (2015):
		- Market/Limit are Hawkes and Cancels are Queue-reactive Poisson - SDE for aggregate features
	- Horst and Xu (2019):
		- Under scaling limits, Hawkes converges to SDE for bid/ask prices and ODE for volume
		- Stationary Intensities of different Event Types form Volterra-Fredholm Integral Equations
 5.13) Limit Order Book Simulations: A Review - Non-linear Hawkes Process
	- Lu and Abergel (2018a):
		- 12D Hawkes: (Limit, Market, Cancel) X (Change Mid, Don't change Mid) X (Bid, Ask)
		- Non-linearity - Kernels floor negative excitation
		- Excitation Kernel is a sum of Exponential Functions
	- Mounjid, Rosenbaum, and Saliba (2019):
		- Non-linear Kernel Function of Event Type, LOB state, time, and sum of past excitations
 5.13) Limit Order Book Simulations: A Review - Neural Hawkes Process
	- Kumar (2021) Deep Neural Hawkes:
		- Market Making Simulations using Agent-based Trading + Hawkes fitted Intensities
		- LSTM augmentation to Mei and Eisner (2017) to capture complex feedback
	- Shi and Cartlidge (2022) Continuous LSTM Deep Neural Hawkes:
		- Order Price/Size drawn from stationary distributions

 #10 - Execution of Portfolio Transactions – Optimal Trajectory (COMPLETED)
 --------------------------
 10.1) Definition of a Static Trading Strategy - Discrete/Continuous Execution Schedule
 10.2) Price Dynamics:
	- Permanent Impact
		- Impact Function is a function of amount traded in the period per unit time
		- Price after Step-wise Permanent Impact
		- Price change impacts the next step
	- Temporary Impact
		- Impact Function is a function of amount traded in the period per unit time
		- Price after Step-wise Temporary Impact
		- Price change DOES NOT impact the next step
	- Capture and Cost Trajectories
		- Capture - Revenue after executing all trades in the schedule
		- Implementation Shortfall - Transaction cost, i.e., ex-post Difference between Initial Book Vaue and Capture
			- Mean E and Variance V of Implementation Shortfall
			- VaR measure => minimize (E + lambda . V)
	- Linear Impact Functions
		- Permanent Impact Function is linear in the amount traded in the period per unit time
			- Price Estimation at t due to permanent impact
			- Implementation Shortfall due to Permanent Impact
			- Therefore permanent impact cost is incremental in the amount traded
		- Temporary Impact Function composed of two additive terms:
			- Term linear in the amount traded in the period per unit time
			- Liquidity Term, viz on bid-ask + fees
			- Therefore temporary impact cost is incremental in the amount traded
		- Expected Shortfall is Linear in all impact coefficients
			- Expected Shortfall is strictly convex on individual n's under certain conditions
			- Expected Shortfall can be simplified further for buy/sell where all n's have same sign
		- Least Impact
			- Equally traded over the full period
			- Expected Implementation Shortfall quadratic in X and (constant + inverse in T)
			- Variance in Implementation Shortfall quadratic in X and linear in T
		- Least Variance
			- Traded fully in a single period
			- Expected Implementation Shortfall quadratic in X and (constant + inverse in T)
				- Therefore fast execution (small T) means high impact
			- Variance is 0
 10.3) Efficient Frontier of Optimal Execution
	- Definition:
		- Trajectory has Lowest Variance for the same or lower Level of expected Transaction Costs
		- Or: Variance V∗ ≥ 0, Trajectory that has minimum expected transaction costs
		- Minimize (E + lambda . V) as a Constrained Optimization
			- Lambda is Lagrange Multiplier
			- Lambda is called "Risk Aversion"
	- Explicit construction of optimal strategies
		- Minimize Lagrangian wrt individual x_i's
		- Tridiagonal linear difference equation on x for i-1, i, i+1
		- When x0 = X and x_N = 0, explicit Hyperbolic form x_n and n_n
		- Corresponding expressions for E and V
		- Reduction to Least Impact/Least Variance Forms
	- Half-life a Trade
		- Comparison of Half-life against T and relation to Least Impact/Least Variance Trajectories
	- Structure of the frontier
		- Boundary represents optimal E/V for a given lambda
 10.4) Risk/Reward Tradeoff
	- Interpretation using a Utility Function, and VaR
	- Utility Function Approach
		- U = E + lambda . V is the Utility
		- Aversion is U''/U'
		- Trajectory are dynamically optimal - as can be explicitly seen in the relation between X_i+1 and X_i
	- Liquidity Value-at-Risk LVaR
		- Minimizes U_p = E + lambda_v . sqrt (V)
			- p is the percentile of implementation shortfall
			- lamda_v is number of standard deviations
		- Uncertainty costs are linear, temporary impact is quadratic
			- So optimal trajectories are linear for large enough portfolios
		- Trajectories are not dynamically optimal as before
 10.5) Value of Information
	- Drift
		- Incorporation of drift into dynamics
		- Expression for V does not change, modification to E
		- New trajectory optimality condition
		- Optimal level of security holding for a time-independent portfolio optimization
		- Optimal trajectory and trade sizes
			- Components of the Trajectory - zero drift part and a drift based correction
		- Bounds on the Utility Gains due to Drift
			- Practical parameters will indicate this is small
	- Serial Correlation
		- Full handling requires dynamic programming
		- First order impact estimation for linear impact functions:
			- Per-period impact cost of “smooth” strategy
			- Per-period gain by adapting to correlations
			- Per-period cost of adapted strategy
			- Per-period Quadratic Optimization Problem
				- Optimal Incremental Shares
				- Maximum Per-period Gain
		- First order impact estimation for non-linear impact functions:
			- Impact cost of adapted strategy
			- Optimal Gain
			- Maximum Gain per Period
		- Practical parameters will indicate this is small
	- Parameter Shifts
		- T* - time at which the event will occur
		- Jump to one of the new set of parameter set with their corresponding probabilities
		- Compartmentalize one trajectory path to T* (X*), and another one from T* to T
		- X* may be determined by minimizing E* + lambda . V* where E* and V* are probability weighted parameter sets
 10.6) Multiple-Security Portfolios
	- Trajectory and Trades are Component Vectors
	- Trading Model
		- Independent Random walks representing Security Level Idiosyncratics
		- Volatility matrix C
		- Permanent Impact G is a vector
		- Temporary Impact H is a vector on bid-ask + h(.)
		- E in terms of G and H
		- V in terms of C, G, and H
		- Breakdown G and H into symmetric and anti-symmetric parts
		- Apply earlier analysis to uncover lambda based optimal trajectories
	- Optimal Trajectories
		- Trajectory Linearization Optimization Equations
		- Lnearly Transform for the trajectory X, and the into A and B from C, G, and H produces a linear system with m.(N-1) variables
	- Explicit Solution for the Diagonal Model
		- No cross-security impact, so G and H are diagonal, C is not
		- Anti-symmetric H is zero, diagonal H must be positive (conditions specified)
		- B is zero, and A eigenized into U
			- kappa is now the eigenvalue
			- Trajectory y's are transformed by U, and trasnformed back into x_i after solving
		- Consequence - trading may be non-monotonic if security prices are highly correlated

 #11 - Non-linear Impact and Trading-Enhanced Risk (COMPLETED)
 --------------------------
 11.1) The Model:
	- X to be fully liquidated by T
	- x chosen to minimize a cost functional
	- Lnear Permanent and non-linear temporary impacts
	- Trading Enhanced Volatility depends on trade rate (n_k / t) and is stochastic to the same stock price factor
	- Capture at each step can be split into:
		- Initial portfolio value XS0
		- Temporary impact component H
		- Permanent Impact Component G
		- Pure Volatility component sigma
		- Trading Enhanced Volatility Component f
	- Total E only depends on H and G (and the trajectory)
	- Total V only depends on sigma and f (and the trajectory)
	- Continuous Limit - t -> 0 and n gets replaced by v_k = n_k / t
	- Continuous Mean and Variance are now time integrals over v(t)
	- U = E + lambda . V as before, except all are continuous
	- Calculations of Variations: minimize U over x(t), i.e., minimize over U the functional Integral F(x,v) dt
		- F(x,v) = x.g + v.h + lambda.sigma^2.x^2 + lambda.f^2.v^2
	- Apply pertubation stationarity to generate the Euler-Lagrange for F(x,v)
		- F(x,v) + v dF(x,-v)/dv = constant
	- Application of the Optimal Trajectory Determination to F(x,v) results in:
		- P(v) - P(0) = x.(g(v) + vg'(v)) + lambda.sigma^2.x^2
		- P(v) = v^2.d(h + lambda.v.f^2)/dv
		- P(0) = 0
	- Additional Assumptions: Permanent Impact is linear, time horizon is infinite
	- Imposing Linear Function provides an integral form for P
		- No Bid-ask spread dependence
	- Impact of Extraneosuly Specified Liquidation Time on P
 11.2) Nonlinear Cost Functions
	- Power Law Temporary Impact Functions
		- Explicit form for P(.) in terms of the power law
		- Almgren P(.) quadrature problem
		- Explicit Form for Longest Optimal Trajectory as a function of Characteristic Time T*
		- Explicit Form for T* - T* is the analog of half-life
		- Intuition behind T*: It is the time that balances:
			- The lambda weighted variance penalty
			- Corresponding execution cost 
		- Sub-linear and supra-linear impact exponent analysis
		- Longest Optimal Time T* as a Function of impact exponent
		- Self-similarity form, i.e., x(t)/X as a function of T* and impact exponent
		- Small t, all trajectories are similar, tail of the trajectories is extended for small impact exponent strongly penalizing trading at slow rates
 11.3) Objective Function
	- Closed Form for E and V as a function of k
	- Closed Form for the Efficient Frontier
	- Asymptotics for Lambda 0 and Infinity

	- Case - beta = 0
	- Closed form for T*
	- Comparison with f(v)=0, k=1 Case
	- Closed Form for E, V
	- Asymptotics for Lambda 0 and infinity
 11.6) Linear Enhanced Risk:
	- Case - beta not 0, alpha = 0
	- Closed form for T*, X*
	- Intuition behind X* - Trading Volatility matches the Linear Enhanced Volatility at this size
	- Comparison with f(v)=0, k=1 Case
	- Closed Form for E, V
	- Asymptotics for Lambda 0 and infinity

	- Locate Hidden Liquidity within bid-ask Spread
	- Remove Displayed Liquidity at:
		- Far-touch => NBO for buy, NBB for sell
		- Near-touch or better => at/above NBB for buy, at/below NBO for sell
	- Dynamic Ping - uses mid-point and limit IOC on a custom venue set (across Exchange/ATS/IOI Venues)
 16.5) Sweep Execution Mode
	- Take Liquidity at best displayed price/better
	- Liquidity displayed at a Custom venue set (across Exchange/ATS/IOI Venues)
	- Use ISO IOC orders
	- Sweep multiple price levels simultaneously
	- Limit price based on depth needed for order fill, overridden only by more conservative client limit price
 16.6) Exchange Post Execution Mode
	- Provide Liquidity for Unmarketable Orders
	- Smart Exchange Post - uses probability of fill in conjunction with price impact on chosen venue
		- May allocate to both displayed and non-displayed liquidity
		- Same venue for both displayed and non-displayed liquidity - results in a single reserve order
	- Dynamic Exchange Post - uses profiles based posting based on venue market share/allocation weights
	- Always uses non-routable DAY limit displayed orders when posting
		- If the non-routable post locks/crosses NBBO, exchange slides the displayed price to a valid increment
	- Re-allocation among Venues when:
		- Child order receives a full fill
		- Minimum Time Elapsed
		- Market Conditions have Changed
	- When locked/crossed, trigger Ping/Sweep to take liquidity
	- Just before opening/closing, reallocate to primary exchange to ensure resting orders participate in auctions
 16.7) Dark Post Execution Mode
	- Provide Hidden Liquidity for Unmarketable Orders
	- Uses Smart Dark Post and Dynamic Dark Post
	- Posts are typically mid-point DAY, overriden by passive or market-peg on client instructions
	- Re-allocation among Venues when:
		- Child order receives a full fill
		- Minimum Time Elapsed
		- Market Conditions have Changed
	- NAGAR posts internally to VIPANI for short time to allow for internal crossing
 16.8) Real-time Venue Selection Criteria:

		- Pricing Structure - Inverted, Maker/Taker
		- Supprt for Order Types/Features
	- Venue Cost - Fees/Rebates
 16.9) Accessible Venues and Execution Modes
 16.10) Order Types and Execution Modes
 16.11) Order Handling Scenarios to Consider
	- Short sell securities in price test are sent to primary exchange, unless overridden
		- Market orders become limit orders with price 1 tick less aggressive than the market impact price
		- Market Impact Price => More restrictive of either Limit Up/Down price and erroneous price
	- Best price venue down - sent to default venue (e.g. BATS)
	- Orders entered prior to open - automatically set for pre-open and continuous trading
		- Continuous ends when symbol goes into closed state on the primary venue
		- If symbol not open at primary by a set time, it is treated as continuous trading
	- Orders with opening/closing TIF sent to primary
	- Symbols halted for traging are routed to primary unless overridden
	- Algorithmic venue selection failure - randomized ranking to select venues
 16.12) PATH Customization Options

 #18 - Indifference price
 --------------------------
 --------------------------
 18.1) Overview
	- Pricing Securities wrt a utility function
	- Also called reservation price or private valuation
	- Price at which the expected utility level is the same by exercising a transaction vs. not doing so (with optimal trading otherwise)
	- Produces Pricing Range - bid/ask or good-deal bounds
 18.2) Mathematics
	- V (x, k) - Supremum of the Terminal of the Expected Utility (u) value of
		- A Portfolio consisting of an initial amount x + k units of an entity (stock, option, etc.)
		- Supremum is taken over all self-financing portfolios
	- Indifference bid price is the solution to V (x - vBid (k), k) = V (x, 0)
	- Indifference bid price is the solution to V (x + vAsk (k), -k) = V (x, 0)
 18.3) Approach
	- Assume portfolio of constituent securities whose weighted market value adds up to x + v
	- Work out V(x + v, k) generically unoptimized across component weights
	- Remember when k = 0, v = 0, compute the optimal value of V(x, k = 0).
		- This is the indifference terminal value.
	- Now work out the optimal weights corresponding to V(x + v, k).
	- You now have the optimal weights in terms of v. Remember V(x + v, k) = V(x, 0). So now solve for v to get v = v(k).

 #20 - Trading Strategy Algo Framework
 --------------------------
 --------------------------
 20.1) Broad Institutional Trading Platform Components
	- Algo Engine
	- FIX Translator
	- Order Validator
	- Risk Management
	- Monitoring
	- Market Data Consumer
	- Post-trade Processor
 20.2) Algo Engine
	- Purpose: Takes the client’s high-level instruction, and decides how and when to slice out child orders
		based on the current state of the market and the pre-loaded quantitative models
	- Core Functional Components
		- Algo Model Data Interface
		- Order Validation Engine
		- Child Order Slicing Interface
		- OMS Venue Interface
		- Market Data Interfacer
		- Security Master Static Data Interface
		- Algo Output Safety Bounds Checker
		- Risk Check Interface
		- Strategy Implementer (e.g., VWAP, DROP LIQUIDITY SEEKER)
		- Timer Service Interface
 20.3) The Trading Strategies (Algos)
	- VWAP - Strategy trades in line with the market volume based on a dynamic volume prediction model
	- DROP LIQUIDITY SEEKER - Hybrid liquidity seeker/impact minimization algo that balances the speed of
		execution with avoiding undue market impact as per its equivalent model, with an opportunistic
		component searching for block liquidity in parallel
	- Safety Customizations - Order must a) complete, b) exclude auctions
 20.4) Trading Logic Components
	- Algo, Scheduler, Order Task, Order Router
	- Algo:
		- Top layer that manages all upstream interactions with the user, e.g., handling new orders and
			amendments, and it creates and manages the Scheduler and the Order Task
		- Responsible for slicing child shares to the opening and the closing auctions
	- Scheduler:
		- Paces the order over the duration using the various quantitative models and the trading logic
		- Pre-trade Scheduler: Suggests the total number of shares to trade over the duration of the order.
		- Impact Minimization Scheduler: Pace at which the Algo should trade at any given time. This is used
			for DROP LIQUIDITY SEEKER orders
		- VWAP Scheduler: Predicts the amount of volume throughout the day and at the auctions based on what
			has happened historically and intra-day so far
	- Order Task and Order Router:
		- Order Task: Manages and deploys three layers of intra-day trading tactics, i.e., routers, and
			shuffles between them as dictated by the Algo
		- Order Router: Router can also stitch together multiple sub-routers, for example a serial mid-point
			all-or-none router + a spread crossing order to the IEX router
		- POST – Passively adding liquidity
			- Starts with a 2:1 split-post on the near-side between IEX D-Limit and the primary exchange
			- Proportionately reshuffles between two legs based on where it gets filled, and re-pegs to the
				inside roughly every 30-60 seconds if the stock drifts away
		- TAKE – immediately removing liquidity
			- First serially pings a handful of dark-pools using all-or-none IOCs, and if that fails, it
				crosses the spread to remove liquidity using the IEX router
		- OPPO – opportunistically seeking block liquidity
			- Searches for block liquidity by split-posting mid-point orders across several dark pools and
				exchanges using a high minimum quantity, generally in the thousands of shares. This may be
				supplemented with other order types such as conditionals
 20.5) Order Lifecyle:
	- Order Arrival:
		- Receipt of a valid order, Algo subscribes to market data and then creates the Scheduler
		- For a VWAP order, the Algo creates VWAP scheduler; for a DROP LIQUIDITY SEEKER order, it creates an
			Impact Minimization Scheduler
		- Then, the Algo registers with the Algo Engine for various wakeup callbacks; at the start time,
			shortly before auction cutoff times, at the cleanup time, i.e., shortly before the end, and at
			the end time
	- Order Wakeups:
		- Upon a Pre-auction Wakeup, the Algo slices shares to the primary auction
		- At the Start Time, the Algo creates the worker and begins the first interval – the Interval logic
		- Upon the Cleanup wakeup, the Algo tells the Worker to complete any remaining scheduled shares
		- Upon the End Time Wakeup, the Algo cancels any outstanding orders and then provides an out to the
			user
	- Order Intervals:
		- Life of an order as a series of distinct 5-10 “intervals”
		- Scheduler Input #1 - Interval Length
			- Length of the interval is used to request a wakeup at the end
			- Interval length depend on other factors too like the time of the day – intervals are stretched
				longer in the morning when spreads are wider, and compressed as the day progresses
			- Additionally, smaller orders have longer intervals and vice versa. All interval durations are
				randomized
		- Scheduler Input #2 - Number of Shares Scheduled
			- VWAP Scheduler uses the dynamic volume prediction model to predict what percentage of the day’s
				volume will have traded by the end of the current interval
			- Impact Minimization Scheduler gets this value by running a dynamic programming cycle of the
				impact minimization model
			- Algo then uses this information to tell the Order Task to complete any shares outstanding from
				previous interval and start working a new interval quantity
			- Additionally, the Algo requests “catch up” wakeups throughout the interval where it checks if
				the Order Task is falling behind, and if so, tells it to cross the spread to keep up pace
			- Throughout the life of a DROP LIQUIDITY SEEKER order, the Algo tells the Order Task to search
				for block liquidity at the mid-point with all remaining unscheduled shares using an
				Opportunistic router
	- Order Amendment:
		- Upon receipt of a client replace request, the Algo generally cancels or amends the Order Task to
			comply with the new instructions
		- Algo also creates a new Scheduler to use from this point forward
 20.6) Trading Objectives/Design Process
	- Low Level:
		- Objective #1 - Avoiding Adverse Selection
			- Prop Firm Perspective - When the market transitions to a new price level, there is a flood of
				trading activity where the fastest proprietary firms race to pick off the resting orders at
				the old price level and establish queue position at the new price level – these are two
				similar but different strategies
			- Sell-side Perspective - As a sell-side firm, it is not plausible to effectively compete in
				these races, so the only viable way to prevent adverse selection is to utilize built-in
				protections available in trading venues, such as IEX D-Peg and D-Limit, and NASDAQ MELO
		- Objective #2 - Removing Liquidity
			- Algo starts off by using the IEX Router when crossing the spread
			- Dark pools are checked using the all-or-none mid-point order prior to crossing the spread
	- High Level:
		- Objective: Optimize Factors that determine how the Algo should spread out trading throughout the
			day
		- Factor #1: How does one measure success at a high level? Using Distilled Impact
		- Factor #2: How much volume does one expect to trade during the life of the order? Volume Prediction
			Model
		- Factor #3: How much should the Algo be willing to trade during the life of the order? Pre-trade
			Model
		- Factor #4: How should one pace the trading activity throughout the life of the order? Impact
			Minimization Model

 #21 - Volume-Weighted Average Approach
 --------------------------
 --------------------------
 21.1) General Hstorical Market Symbol Cumulative Volume to Time t vs. Realized Symbol Volume at Time t
	- Of course, and their VWAP
 21.2) Problem Formulation
	- Daily Time Interval (09:30 to 16:00) divv'ied into delta t = 10 minute intervals
	- Opening Auction Volume is up to 09:30
	- Closing Auction Volume is after 16:00 (say 16:10)
	- Historical Time-wise Average Volume V_hist and Traded Percentage X_hist (based on rolling delta d = 20 day average)
	- Historical Time-wise 20 day ADV
	- Realized Time-wise Average Volume V_realized and Traded Percentage X_realized
	- Decision to catch up or wait or do nothing
		- If catch up, how much
		- It wait, how long
		- Do nothing - if the catch up market impact is too high
	- Volume Prediction mismatch Metric
		- |Historical(t) - Realized(t)| Integrand
 21.3) Estimation of Predicted Volume Fraction R(t)
	- ADV Normalized Trading Volume A(t) = V(t)/ADV
	- Observations Grouped by V_hist(t) and A(t)
	- Predicted Volume Fraction R(t) is the average of X_hist(t) across a single grouping of V_hist(t) and A(t)
 21.4) Partial Trading Days
	- Need estimates for volume fraction start and volume fraction end times
	- Smooth, monotonic interpolation
