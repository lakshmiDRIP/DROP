 #1 - Exchange Order (COMPLETED)
 --------------------------
 1.1) Market Order
	- Immediate Execution at Current Prices - Lowest Commissions/Fees
 1.2) Limit Order
	- Orders with least acceptable price - execution should be at a better price
		- Execution Uncertainty, i.e., may not be "marketable"
	- Buy Limit/Sell Limit Orders
	- FOK - either filled completely on the first attempt or canceled outright
	- AON - must be filled with the entire number of shares specified, or not at all. If not filled, posted on the order book
 1.3) Time-in-Force
	- Closing Time: Equities - specified by exchange; FX - 5 PM EST except for NZD
	- DAY/GFD: Order valid till close
	- GTC: Order valid until Cancel - some brokers may limit it to, say, 90 days
	- IOC: Immediate execution or cancel - allows for partial fill (unlike FOK)
	- Single Price Open/Close Auctions - some exchanges also have before/after lunch auctions
	- At the open/close - orders must be in 20 min or so prior
	- MOC/MOO/LOC/LOO
	- Reg NMS IOC orders can be re-routed on sweep
 1.4) Conditional - Executed when conditions are met (not just price, which is limit order)
	- Conditional Stop Order:
		- Execute once market price (mid?) reaches the stop level. Upon reaching that, order becomes market order, so no price certainty.
		- Buy Stop and Sell Stop
		- Execution price may be different from the stop limit
		- Used in exchanges more than in OTC
		- Stop Limit Order - Sets a limit price, so price certainty, less execution certainty.
		- Trailing Stop Order - contains a stop parameter that creates a moving or trailing activation price
			- E.g., 10% below current market price
			- Trailing parameter base refresh frequency, i.e., determination of when is current
		- Trailing Stop-Limit Order - Trailing Stop + a limit price
	- Conditional Peg Orders
		- Market Maker Behavior. Uses a "stepper" logic.
		- Peg Best:
			- Like a real market maker, the stepper:
				- Uses the other side of the spread
				- Always jumps over the competitors order to be the best one, the first in the line
				- No-step over conditions are:
					- Price limitation, no more jumping over, unless the price moves back to its area
					- Step Value
			- Peg Mid-price - Limit price is average of BBO National or local
				- Popular in ATS and Dark pool, participants pay half of spread
	- Market-if-touched - Market Order if market price "touches" specified level
		- Buy/Sell variants
	- One cancels other
	- One sends other
	- Tick-sensitive Orders - e.g., buy on downtick. Short sell orders are tick-sensitive
	- At-the-opening: If not executable, cancel it
 1.5) Discretionary - Delayed by broker for a better price - augments other types - also referred as not-held
 1.6) Bracket - Market a Pair of two orders, e.g., lock profit and floor losses
 1.7) Quantity and display instructions - Display Instructions can be customized. Icebaer'g only diplay partially
	- E.g., AON to display if there is a fill
 1.8) Electronic Markets Order Priority
	- Market > Limit > ...
	- Simplest Limit highest priority
	- Conditional priority when met first-come
	- Iceberg/Dark-Pool Undisplayed Liquidity Least Priority

 4.1) RFQ vs. Order Book
 --------------------------


 --------------------------
 #5 - How storing Supply and Demand affects Price Diffusion
 --------------------------
 --------------------------
 5.1) Market Order - Arrives in chunks of σ shares at μ shares per unit time
	- Equal probability for buy and sell orders
	- SIze distibution with standard deviation √(2/π) σ
 5.2) Limit Order - Arrives in chunks of σ shares at α shares per unit price per unit time
 5.3) Limit Offers placed at a uniform probability at integer multiples of a tick size p_0 in the range b(t)<p<∞ and for bids on -∞<p<a(t)
 5.4) Explicit Limit Order Removal Rate: Constant probability δ per unit time
 5.5) Depth profile N(p,t): Density of shares in the order book at price p and time t
	- Positive for bids and negative for offers
	- Depth of bids/offers using price coordinates centered at the midpoint m(t) so that b(t)≡-a(t)
 5.6) π(N,p,t) => Probability that an interval dp centered around price p has N shares at time t
	- P_+ (∆p,t) be the probability that m(t) increases by ∆p
	- P_- (∆p,t) be the probability that it decreases by ∆p
 5.7) Ignoring Joint Event Occurrence: α, Nδ, P_+, and P_- small so that higher order terms corresponding to simultaneous events are neglected
 5.8) General Master Equation for π
	- ∂π(N,p)/∂t=
		α(p)dp/σ [π(N-σ,p)-π(N,p)]+
		δ/σ [(N+σ)π(N+σ,p)-Nπ(N,p)]+
		μ(p)/2σ [π(N+σ,p)-π(N,p)]+
		∑_∆p▒〖P_+ (∆p)[π(N,p-∆p)-π(N,p)] 〗+
		∑_∆p▒〖P_- (∆p)[π(N,p+∆p)-π(N,p)] 〗
 5.9) Component Contributions to Master Density:
	- α term to receipt of a limit order
	- δ term to spontaneous removal of a limit order
	- μ term to the receipt of the market order
	- P_+ term to an increase in the midpoint m(t)→m(t)+∆p
	- P_- term to a decrease m(t)→m(t)-∆p
 5.10) Co-moving Reference Frame for Mid-price Diffusion:
	- Last two terms imply a diffusion for the depth when viewed in the co-moving reference of price coordinate when the midpoint moves
 5.11) Definition of the Best Offer: π(N,p)=0 for p<0
 5.12) Mean-field Solution:
	- Approximate solution to master equation is found by:
		- Relating P_+ (∆p) and P_- (∆p) self-consistently to mean-functional forms α(p) and μ(p) for which α and μ furnish boundary conditions
	- Steady-state mean value 〈N(p)〉 obtained from the generating functional for the moments of π
	- Simulation matches the leading order properties mean-field solution
 5.13) Market Impact:
	- Definition ∆p=ϕ(ω,τ,t)
	- Intuitive expectation for convex impact
	- Origin of the Concave Impact
		- Instantaneous Price Impact - ϕ(ω,0,t)
		- Average depth 〈N(p)〉 approximated as a smooth function that vanishes at the midpoint
		- Taylor Expansion for Average Depth 〈N(p)〉≈2λp - time varying liquidity λ(t)
		- Walking the Order Book Depth:
			- Price shift caused by a market order ω>0 approximated by ω=∫_0^Δp▒N(p,t)dp
		- Linear Approximation over Time Averages 〈∆p(ω)〉=〈√(ω/λ(t) )〉
 5.14) Scaling using Flow Quantities:
	- Ignoring the effects caused by finite bin size p_0 and finite order size σ
	- Fundamental dimensional quantities are shares, price, and time
	- Non-dimensional Spread is μ/σ
	- Non-dimensional Asymptotic Depth is α/δ
	- Non dimensional Liquidity α^2/μδ
	- Non-dimensional Volatility (δμ^2)/σ^2 Derived as:
		- Square 〈∆p(ω)〉=〈√(ω/λ(t) )〉
		- Substitute ω=μ and λ=σ^2/μδ
		- Diffusion Rate: Slope of V[m(t+τ)-m(t)] vs. τ
		- Multiple Diffusion Timescales - Short Term vs Long Term
 5.15) Scaling using Flow + Granularity Quantities:
	- Fundamental Discreteness Dimensional Quantities: σ, which has the dimensions of shares, and p_0, which has the dimensions of price
	- Non-dimensional Order Granularity and Tick σ ̂=σδ/μ
	- Non-dimensional tick p ̂=(p_0 α)/μ
	- Well-defined continuum limit with respect to the non-dimensional tick (p_0 α)/μ
	- No non-dimensional granularity parameter σδ/μ, i.e., does not affect the slope, spread, or asymptotic depth, but affects price diffusion
	- Granularity Dependence on Diffusion
		- Product of the continuum diffusion rate (δμ^2)/σ^2  and a τ-dependent power of the non-dimensional granularity parameter δσ/μ
		- Power is -1/2 for short term diffusion and 1/2 for long-term diffusion
	- Weak autocorrelations in price differences m(t)-m(t-1) that persist for timescales until the variance vs τ becomes a straight line
		- Timescale depends on the parameters, but typically 50
		- Temporal Market-Impact Coefficient: 〈∆p〉=〈ϕ(ω,τ)〉=f(τ) √ω
			- f(τ) decreases from its initial value, reaching a non-zero asymptotic f(∞)

 #6 - Statistical Theory of Continuous Double Action
 --------------------------
 --------------------------
 6.1) Overview of the Model Predictions – Varying the Granularity Parameter ϵ
	- Limit of ε_p→0
	- Large ϵ: ϵ≳0.01
		- Large accumulation of the orders near best bid and the best ask
		- Nearly linear market impact
		- Equal short- and long-term diffusion
		- Regime where the mean-field approximation used works best
	- Medium ϵ: ϵ∼0.01
		- Accumulation of orders at the best bid and the best ask is small
		- Near the midpoint the depth profile increases linearly with price
		- Approximation: Price increases roughly as square root of the order size
	- Small ϵ: ϵ≲0.001
		- Accumulation of orders at the best bid and the best ask is very small
		- Near the midpoint the depth profile is a convex function of the price
		- Price impact is very concave
		- Short-term price diffusion rate is much smaller than the long-term price diffusion rate
 6.2) Overview of the Model Predictions – Varying the Granularity Parameter ϵ; Depth Profile
	- Dimensonless Depth Profile: n ̂=(np_c)/N_c =nδ/α
	- Cumulative Depth Profile: N(p,t)=∑_(p ̃=0)^p▒〖n(p ̃,t) ε_p 〗
	- Dimensonless Cumulative Depth Profile: N ̂(p)=N(p)/N_c =2δN(p)/μ=N(p)ϵ/μ
	- High ϵ Regime Depth Profile:
		- Annihilation due to market orders is low relative to δσ
		- Significant accumulation of the orders at the best ask
		- Average depth is much greater than zero at its mid-point
		- Mean depth profile is a concave function of price
	- Medium ϵ Regime Depth Profile:
		- Market order removal increases, depleting the average depth near the best ask
		- Profile is nearly linear over p/p_c ≤1
	- Low ϵ Regime Depth Profile:
		- Market order removal increases further, average depth near the ask very close to zero
		- Profile is convex over the range p/p_c ≤1
	- Standard Deviation of the Cumulative Depth:
		- Comparable to the mean depth
		- As ϵ increases, near midpoint there is a similar transition from convex to concave behavior
	- Density of executed orders decreases rapidly as a function of the distance from the midpoint
 6.3) Overview of the Model Predictions – Varying the Granularity Parameter ϵ; Liquidity for Market Orders: The Price Impact Function
	- Instantaneous Price Impact: ϕ(t,ω,τ→0)
	- Permanent Price Impact: ϕ(t,ω,τ→∞)
	- Price Impact Continuum over Depth: ω=N(p,t)=∫_0^p▒〖n(p ̃,t)dp ̃ 〗
	- Price Impact in Large ϵ Regime: n(p) is constant so price impact is roughly linear
	- Median ϵ Price Impact: Assumption that n(p) is linearly increasing and n(0)≈0 => mean price should increase roughly as √ω
	- Small ϵ Price Impact: n(0)≈0 means:

		- Depth profile n(p) is convex

 6.5) Overview of the Mode Parameters – Varying the Granularity Parameter ϵ; Spread
	- Spread Probability Density at s/p_c =0:
		- Spread probability density is substantial at s/p_c =0 which is the limit ε_p→0
	- Peak of the Spread Density: At approximately 0.2p_c
	- Spread Dependence on ϵ: Spread is very small for large ϵ, and large for small ϵ
	- Depth Fluctuations for Large ϵ:
		- For large ϵ the fluctuations around the mean depth are roughly independent
		- Probability for a market order to penetrate at a given price level is:
			- Probability that all the ticks smaller than the price level contain no orders, which gives rise to an exponential decay
	- Behavior for Small ϵ:
		- For small ϵ, the probability distribution of the spread becomes insensitive to ϵ
	- Mean Spread increases with ϵ
 6.6) Overview of the Mode Parameters – Varying the Granularity Parameter ϵ; Volatility and Price Diffusion
	- Characteristic Step for Random Walk: μ/2α
	- Characteristic Time for Random Walk: 1/δ
	- Diffusion Rate from Order Flow: (μ^2 δ)/α^2 
	- Multiple Diffusion Timescales:
		- Faster diffusion rate for short timescales
		- Slower diffusion rate for long timescales
 6.7) Overview of the Mode Parameters – Varying the Granularity Parameter ϵ; Liquidity for Limit Orders: Probability and Time-to-Fill
	- Liquidity for Limit Orders: Depends on the probability that they will be filled, and the time to be filled
		- Limit orders close to transaction prices filled more quickly
	- Limit Order Fill Probability: Decreases with ϵ
		- High ϵ - This is less than 1 even for negative prices - even for sells close best bid, significant chance that the offer is deleted before execution
			- Not true for Low ϵ
		- Fill Probability ϵ Crossover: Around p=p_c, after which the above low/high ϵ probability of fill reverses
 6.8) Overview of the Mode Parameters – Varying the Tick Size ε_p/p_c 
	- Qualitative changes in behavior are relatively minor
 6.9) Theoretical Analysis – Characterizing Limit-order Books: Dual Coordinates
	- Price Space: Bins of length ε_p representing the ticks
	- Sign Convention for n(p,t)
	- Cumulative Order Count LOB Representation: N(p,t)=∑_(-∞)^(p-ε_p)▒|n(p,t)| -∑_(-∞)^(a-ε_p)▒|n(p,t)| 
	- N↔Price Inverse Relation: p(N,t)=max⁡{p | N(p,t)=N}
		- p(0,t)≡a(t)
		- p(-1,t)≡b(t)
		- x(N,t)=p(N,t)-p(N-1,t)
	- Instantaneous Bid-Ask Spread:x(0,t)=a(t)-b(t)
	- Symmetric Order Placement Rules:
		- n(p,t)→-n(-p,t)
		- x(N,t)→x(-N,t)
 6.10) Theoretical Analysis: Frames and Martingales
	- Stationary Nature of x(N,t) Specification
	- Nonstationary Nature of p(N,t) or n(p,t)
		- Stationary Distributions in Comoving Frames
	- Centered Configurations:
		- Bid-centered configuration: n_b (p,t)=n(p-b(t),t)
		- Mid-centered configuration: n_m (p,t)=n(p-m(t),t)
	- Mid-centered Ask: s(t)/2
	- Bid centered Balance Constraint => μ/2=∑_(b+ε_p)^∞▒[α-δ〈n_b (p)〉] 
	- Mid centered Balance Constraint => μ/2=α 〈s〉/2+∑_(b+ε_p)^∞▒[α-δ〈n_m (p)〉]  
	- Bid-centered Ask: α〈m-b〉=α〈s〉/2
 6.11) Theoretical Analysis: Factorization Tests
	- Marginal Equation using Independent Marginals: P[{n(p_i )}_i ]=∏_i▒P[n(p_i )] 
	- Explicit Relation for Spread Probability: P[s/2<p]=1-e^(-∑_(p^'=b+ε_p)^(b+ε_p)▒〈n_m (p^' )〉 )
	- Validity at High ϵ: Mean-density profile at the midpoint 〈n_m (0)〉≲1 and strongly concave demand
		- Approximation of independent fluctuations is excellent
	- Validity at Intermediate ϵ: 〈n_m (0)〉≪1 and nearly linear, and the approximation of independence is marginal
	- Validity at Small ϵ: 〈n_m (0)〉≪1 and concave upward - approximation of independent fluctuations is invalid
 6.12) Theoretical Analysis: Master Equations and Mean Field Approximations
	- Independence of N(p,t)/p(N,t) Fluctuations:
		- Probabilities may be defined for any density n(p,t) independently at each p => Mid-centering for n(p,t)
		- Separation intervals x(N,t) independently at each N => x(N,t) is well-defined without reference to any frame
 6.13) Master Equations and Mean Field Approximations – A Number Density Equation

		- Limit Order Arrival Component:
			- Depositions of discrete orders at (α(p) ε_p)/σ
			- Raises configurations from n-σ to n shares at p
		- Order Cancelation/Removal Component: Number of orders that can independently decay
		- Market Order Arrival Component: μ(p)/2σ describes market order annihilations
		- Up/Down Frame Price Shifts: Preceding three effects lead to shifts of the origin by ∆p and P_±
		- Assumption Valid Outside the Spread, not Inside
			- Rigorous Inside-Spread Density Handling: Require replacing the product with a sum of products conditioned on states of the order book
	- α(p) in a Bid-centered Frame: α(p) takes a fixed value α(∞) at all p
	- α(p) in Mid-centered Frame: Depositions below the midpoint causes shifts that deposit orders above the midpoint
	- μ(p) in Mid-centered Frame: Rate of market orders surviving to cancel limit orders at p
	- Price Range of μ(p) Values: μ(0)/2 to 0 at p→∞
	- Time Parameters for the Simulation: α(∞) and μ(0) are, thus, the parameters α and μ of the simulation

	- MGF Functional for π(n,p): Π(λ,p)=∑_(n/σ=0)^∞▒〖λ^(n/σ) π(n,p) 〗
	- MGF at λ=0 and λ=1
		- Π(0,p)=π(0,p)=π_0 (p)
		- ∑_n▒π(n,p,t) =1 implies Π(1,p)=1 ∀p
	- Linear Approximation of MGF across λ
		- |∂Π(λ,p)/∂λ|_(λ→1)=〈n(p)〉/σ
		- In the neighborhood of λ=1 linear approximation:  Π(λ,p)=1+(λ-1)  〈n(p)〉/σ+O([λ-1]^2 )
	- Multiplying Stationary Master Equation by λ^(n/σ) and summing over n, the stationary solution for Π(λ,p) must satisfy:
		- 0=(λ-1)/p |α(p) ε_p Π(λ,p)-δσ ∂Π(λ,p)/∂λ-μ(p)/2λ [Π(λ,p)-π_0 (p)]|_(λ,p)+∑_∆p▒〖P_+ (∆p)[Π(λ,p-∆p)-Π(λ,p)] 〗+∑_∆p▒〖P_- (∆p)[Π(λ,p+∆p)-Π(λ,p)] 〗

	- Frame Diffusivity Stationary Master Equation:
		- ∂Π(λ,p)/∂λ-D/δ(λ-1)   (∂^2 Π(λ,p))/(∂λ^2 )-(α(p) ε_p-μ(p)/2λ)/δσ Π(λ,p)=μ(p)/2δσλ π_0 (p)
	- Using Linear MGF Approximation at λ→1:
		- 〈n(p)〉-D/δ  (∂^2 〈n(p)〉)/(∂p^2 )=(α(p) ε_p)/δ-μ(p)/2δ [1-π_0 (p)]
	- Simplification under ε_p→0:
		- Eligible values of any 〈n(p)〉 become just σ and 0, thus 〈n(p)〉=σ[1-π_0 (p)]
		- Result: (α(p) ε_p)/δ=μ(p)/2δ 〈n(p)〉+〈n(p)〉-D/δ  (∂^2 〈n(p)〉)/(∂p^2 )
	- Nondimensional Form of Stationary Master:
		- α(p)/α(∞) =[μ(p)/μ(0) +ϵ(1-D/δ  ∂^2/(∂p^2 ))]  1/ϵ  δ〈n(p)〉/(α(p) ε_p )
	- 〈n(p)〉 Far from the Midpoint:
		- Only depositions and cancelations take place
		- Orders in bins of width ε_p are Poisson-distributed with mean (α(∞) ε_p)/δ
		- Therefore asymptotic value of δ〈n(p)〉/(α(∞) ε_p ) at large p is unity
	- Asymptotic α(p) and μ(p) at p→∞:
		- Consistent with a limit α(p)/α(∞)  of unity, and a limit for the second μ(p)/μ(0)  to zero

 #7 - Limit Order Book Simulations: A Review
 --------------------------
 --------------------------
 7.1) Limit Order Book Dynamics
	- Buy Section vs. Sell Section
		- Levels separated by one tick
		- Best Bid vs Best Ask and Spread/Mid
	- Levels based on Price
		- Orders at each Level (orders have quantity)
		- Aggregate Level Quantity
	- Order Categories - Limit/Market/Cancel
		- Market Order - drains liquidity at the corresponding side
		- Limit Order - post liquidity
		- Cancel Order - remove posted liquidity
 7.2) Order Book Dynamics S_t
	- Order Book State Dependence at Level x:
		- Best Bid/Ask Price
		- Bid/Ask Volumes at x
	- Order Book Events:
		- Market Orders Bid/Ask - A/E
		- In-spread Limit Orders Bid/Ask - B/F
		- Cancel Orders Bid/Ask - C/G
		- Not In-spread Limit Orders Bid/Ask - D/H
	- Order Book Evolution: S_t+1 = S_t + D_t(S_t)
	- Dynamics Induced:
		- Market Order Buy/Sell Queue-clearing - one/more tick moves up/down
		- Market Order Buy/Sell Non-Queue-clearing - changes volume not prices
 7.3) Stylized Facts:
	- Cont (2011):
		- Price changes anti-correlated at small time lags, uncorrelated at longer lags
		- Trading Volumes are heterogenous and strongly auto-correlated
		- Trading volumes show strong intra-day seasonality
		- Order durations are auto-correlated; positive correlation across order types

		- Auto-correlation of returns - vanishes with delta t
			- Auto-correlation of squared returns - measures "Volatility Clustering"
		- Volatility and Volume positively correlated; Volatility and Returns negatively correlated

 #12 - Execution of Portfolio Transactions – Optimal Trajectory (COMPLETED)
 --------------------------
 12.1) Definition of a Static Trading Strategy - Discrete/Continuous Execution Schedule
 12.2) Price Dynamics:
	- Permanent Impact
		- Impact Function is a function of amount traded in the period per unit time
		- Price after Step-wise Permanent Impact
		- Price change impacts the next step
	- Temporary Impact
		- Impact Function is a function of amount traded in the period per unit time
		- Price after Step-wise Temporary Impact
		- Price change DOES NOT impact the next step
	- Capture and Cost Trajectories
		- Capture - Revenue after executing all trades in the schedule
		- Implementation Shortfall - Transaction cost, i.e., ex-post Difference between Initial Book Vaue and Capture
			- Mean E and Variance V of Implementation Shortfall
			- VaR measure => minimize (E + lambda . V)
	- Linear Impact Functions
		- Permanent Impact Function is linear in the amount traded in the period per unit time
			- Price Estimation at t due to permanent impact
			- Implementation Shortfall due to Permanent Impact
			- Therefore permanent impact cost is incremental in the amount traded
		- Temporary Impact Function composed of two additive terms:
			- Term linear in the amount traded in the period per unit time
			- Liquidity Term, viz on bid-ask + fees
			- Therefore temporary impact cost is incremental in the amount traded
		- Expected Shortfall is Linear in all impact coefficients
			- Expected Shortfall is strictly convex on individual n's under certain conditions
			- Expected Shortfall can be simplified further for buy/sell where all n's have same sign
		- Least Impact
			- Equally traded over the full period
			- Expected Implementation Shortfall quadratic in X and (constant + inverse in T)
			- Variance in Implementation Shortfall quadratic in X and linear in T
		- Least Variance
			- Traded fully in a single period
			- Expected Implementation Shortfall quadratic in X and (constant + inverse in T)
				- Therefore fast execution (small T) means high impact
			- Variance is 0
 12.3) Efficient Frontier of Optimal Execution
	- Definition:
		- Trajectory has Lowest Variance for the same or lower Level of expected Transaction Costs
		- Or: Variance V∗ ≥ 0, Trajectory that has minimum expected transaction costs
		- Minimize (E + lambda . V) as a Constrained Optimization
			- Lambda is Lagrange Multiplier
			- Lambda is called "Risk Aversion"
	- Explicit construction of optimal strategies
		- Minimize Lagrangian wrt individual x_i's
		- Tridiagonal linear difference equation on x for i-1, i, i+1
		- When x0 = X and x_N = 0, explicit Hyperbolic form x_n and n_n
		- Corresponding expressions for E and V
		- Reduction to Least Impact/Least Variance Forms
	- Half-life a Trade
		- Comparison of Half-life against T and relation to Least Impact/Least Variance Trajectories
	- Structure of the frontier
		- Boundary represents optimal E/V for a given lambda
 12.4) Risk/Reward Tradeoff
	- Interpretation using a Utility Function, and VaR
	- Utility Function Approach
		- U = E + lambda . V is the Utility
		- Aversion is U''/U'
		- Trajectory are dynamically optimal - as can be explicitly seen in the relation between X_i+1 and X_i
	- Liquidity Value-at-Risk LVaR
		- Minimizes U_p = E + lambda_v . sqrt (V)
			- p is the percentile of implementation shortfall
			- lamda_v is number of standard deviations
		- Uncertainty costs are linear, temporary impact is quadratic
			- So optimal trajectories are linear for large enough portfolios
		- Trajectories are not dynamically optimal as before
 12.5) Value of Information
	- Drift
		- Incorporation of drift into dynamics
		- Expression for V does not change, modification to E
		- New trajectory optimality condition
		- Optimal level of security holding for a time-independent portfolio optimization
		- Optimal trajectory and trade sizes
			- Components of the Trajectory - zero drift part and a drift based correction
		- Bounds on the Utility Gains due to Drift
			- Practical parameters will indicate this is small
	- Serial Correlation
		- Full handling requires dynamic programming
		- First order impact estimation for linear impact functions:
			- Per-period impact cost of “smooth” strategy
			- Per-period gain by adapting to correlations
			- Per-period cost of adapted strategy
			- Per-period Quadratic Optimization Problem
				- Optimal Incremental Shares
				- Maximum Per-period Gain
		- First order impact estimation for non-linear impact functions:
			- Impact cost of adapted strategy
			- Optimal Gain
			- Maximum Gain per Period
		- Practical parameters will indicate this is small
	- Parameter Shifts
		- T* - time at which the event will occur
		- Jump to one of the new set of parameter set with their corresponding probabilities
		- Compartmentalize one trajectory path to T* (X*), and another one from T* to T
		- X* may be determined by minimizing E* + lambda . V* where E* and V* are probability weighted parameter sets
 12.6) Multiple-Security Portfolios
	- Trajectory and Trades are Component Vectors
	- Trading Model
		- Independent Random walks representing Security Level Idiosyncratics
		- Volatility matrix C
		- Permanent Impact G is a vector
		- Temporary Impact H is a vector on bid-ask + h(.)
		- E in terms of G and H
		- V in terms of C, G, and H
		- Breakdown G and H into symmetric and anti-symmetric parts
		- Apply earlier analysis to uncover lambda based optimal trajectories
	- Optimal Trajectories
		- Trajectory Linearization Optimization Equations
		- Lnearly Transform for the trajectory X, and the into A and B from C, G, and H produces a linear system with m.(N-1) variables
	- Explicit Solution for the Diagonal Model
		- No cross-security impact, so G and H are diagonal, C is not
		- Anti-symmetric H is zero, diagonal H must be positive (conditions specified)
		- B is zero, and A eigenized into U
			- kappa is now the eigenvalue
			- Trajectory y's are transformed by U, and trasnformed back into x_i after solving
		- Consequence - trading may be non-monotonic if security prices are highly correlated

 #13 - Non-linear Impact and Trading-Enhanced Risk (COMPLETED)
 --------------------------
 13.1) The Model:
	- X to be fully liquidated by T
	- x chosen to minimize a cost functional
	- Lnear Permanent and non-linear temporary impacts
	- Trading Enhanced Volatility depends on trade rate (n_k / t) and is stochastic to the same stock price factor
	- Capture at each step can be split into:
		- Initial portfolio value XS0
		- Temporary impact component H
		- Permanent Impact Component G
		- Pure Volatility component sigma
		- Trading Enhanced Volatility Component f
	- Total E only depends on H and G (and the trajectory)
	- Total V only depends on sigma and f (and the trajectory)
	- Continuous Limit - t -> 0 and n gets replaced by v_k = n_k / t
	- Continuous Mean and Variance are now time integrals over v(t)
	- U = E + lambda . V as before, except all are continuous
	- Calculations of Variations: minimize U over x(t), i.e., minimize over U the functional Integral F(x,v) dt
		- F(x,v) = x.g + v.h + lambda.sigma^2.x^2 + lambda.f^2.v^2
	- Apply pertubation stationarity to generate the Euler-Lagrange for F(x,v)
		- F(x,v) + v dF(x,-v)/dv = constant
	- Application of the Optimal Trajectory Determination to F(x,v) results in:
		- P(v) - P(0) = x.(g(v) + vg'(v)) + lambda.sigma^2.x^2
		- P(v) = v^2.d(h + lambda.v.f^2)/dv
		- P(0) = 0
	- Additional Assumptions: Permanent Impact is linear, time horizon is infinite
	- Imposing Linear Function provides an integral form for P
		- No Bid-ask spread dependence
	- Impact of Extraneosuly Specified Liquidation Time on P
 13.2) Nonlinear Cost Functions
	- Power Law Temporary Impact Functions
		- Explicit form for P(.) in terms of the power law
		- Almgren P(.) quadrature problem
		- Explicit Form for Longest Optimal Trajectory as a function of Characteristic Time T*
		- Explicit Form for T* - T* is the analog of half-life
		- Intuition behind T*: It is the time that balances:
			- The lambda weighted variance penalty
			- Corresponding execution cost 
		- Sub-linear and supra-linear impact exponent analysis
		- Longest Optimal Time T* as a Function of impact exponent
		- Self-similarity form, i.e., x(t)/X as a function of T* and impact exponent
		- Small t, all trajectories are similar, tail of the trajectories is extended for small impact exponent strongly penalizing trading at slow rates
 13.3) Objective Function
	- Closed Form for E and V as a function of k
	- Closed Form for the Efficient Frontier
	- Asymptotics for Lambda 0 and Infinity
 13.4) Trading-Enhanced Risk

	- Closed Form for E, V, and therefore P(v, lambda)
 13.5) Constant Enhanced Risk:
	- Case - beta = 0
	- Closed form for T*
	- Comparison with f(v)=0, k=1 Case
	- Closed Form for E, V
	- Asymptotics for Lambda 0 and infinity
 13.6) Linear Enhanced Risk:
	- Case - beta not 0, alpha = 0
	- Closed form for T*, X*
	- Intuition behind X* - Trading Volatility matches the Linear Enhanced Volatility at this size
	- Comparison with f(v)=0, k=1 Case
	- Closed Form for E, V
	- Asymptotics for Lambda 0 and infinity

 --------------------------
 16.1) Price Model Using Bayesian Update
	- Arithmetic Walk - Time is volume time relative to a historical profile
	- Volatility comes from Activity of the “uninformed” traders
	- Drift from the activity of other institutional traders
	- α is Unknown constant throughout the day
	- α~N(α ̅,ν^2)
	- Sources of Randomness

 16.2) Optimal Trading Strategies
	- Risk Aversion Lambda set to zero, so focus is on trading cost reduction
	- Positive Drift Assumption
	- Hard Completion at T
	- Forward Execution Cost Conditional on α
	- α Estimate Conditional on S - α_* (t,S)
	- Bayesian Estimate of Unrealized Cost - E[t,x(t),S,{x(t)}]=η∫_t^T▒〖v^2 (τ)dτ〗+α_* (t,S) ∫_t^T▒x(τ)dτ
	- Strategy Objective - Minimizing Transaction Cost - ■(min@{x(τ)} ) E[t,x(t),S,{x(τ)}]
	- α_* (t,S) assumed not to change during t≤τ≤T
	- Dynamically Recomputed Unrealized Trajectory Cost
	- Equivalence with Full Dynamic Optimization
 16.3) Optimal Trajectories by Calculus of Variations
	- Trajectory Perturbation Fixed at the End-points x(τ)↦x(τ)+∆x(τ) => ∆x(t)=∆x(T)=0
	- Corresponding Bayesian Cost Impact => ∆E[t,x(t),S,{x(t)}]=∫_t^T▒{-2ηx^'' (τ)+α_* (t,S)}[∆x(τ)]dτ

	- Sign Unconstrained Trajectories - Holdings ODE
	- Sign Unconstrained Trajectory - The Holding Solution
		- x(τ)=(T-τ)/(T-t) x(t)-α_*/4η (τ-t)(T-τ)
			- First piece is proportional to x(t) - is the linear VWA) liquidation of the current position

 #17 - Smart Order Routing
 --------------------------
 17.1) Addresses problems of venue proliferation and liquidity fragmentation
 --------------------------
 --------------------------

 --------------------------
 #18 - Nagar – Algos and Smart Order Router
 --------------------------
 --------------------------
 18.1) Algos - NAGAR; Venue - VIPANI; Router - PATH
 18.2) Components - Scheduler, Order Placement, Router
	- Order Placement invokes the Router using the Execution Modes
 18.3) Execution Modes - Ping, Sweep, Exchange Post, Dark Post
	- On Marketability - Follow Ping, Sweep, Exchange Post in that order
	- Dark Post exclusive to the other modes
 18.4) Ping Execution Mode
	- Locate Hidden Liquidity within bid-ask Spread
	- Remove Displayed Liquidity at:
		- Far-touch => NBO for buy, NBB for sell
		- Near-touch or better => at/above NBB for buy, at/below NBO for sell
	- Dynamic Ping - uses mid-point and limit IOC on a custom venue set (across Exchange/ATS/IOI Venues)
 18.5) Sweep Execution Mode
	- Take Liquidity at best displayed price/better
	- Liquidity displayed at a Custom venue set (across Exchange/ATS/IOI Venues)
	- Use ISO IOC orders
	- Sweep multiple price levels simultaneously
	- Limit price based on depth needed for order fill, overridden only by more conservative client limit price
 18.6) Exchange Post Execution Mode
	- Provide Liquidity for Unmarketable Orders
	- Smart Exchange Post - uses probability of fill in conjunction with price impact on chosen venue
		- May allocate to both displayed and non-displayed liquidity
		- Same venue for both displayed and non-displayed liquidity - results in a single reserve order
	- Dynamic Exchange Post - uses profiles based posting based on venue market share/allocation weights
	- Always uses non-routable DAY limit displayed orders when posting
		- If the non-routable post locks/crosses NBBO, exchange slides the displayed price to a valid increment
	- Re-allocation among Venues when:
		- Child order receives a full fill
		- Minimum Time Elapsed
		- Market Conditions have Changed
	- When locked/crossed, trigger Ping/Sweep to take liquidity
	- Just before opening/closing, reallocate to primary exchange to ensure resting orders participate in auctions
 18.7) Dark Post Execution Mode
	- Provide Hidden Liquidity for Unmarketable Orders
	- Uses Smart Dark Post and Dynamic Dark Post
	- Posts are typically mid-point DAY, overriden by passive or market-peg on client instructions
	- Re-allocation among Venues when:
		- Child order receives a full fill
		- Minimum Time Elapsed
		- Market Conditions have Changed
	- NAGAR posts internally to VIPANI for short time to allow for internal crossing
 18.8) Real-time Venue Selection Criteria:
	- Available Price - Sorted best Price Venues when taking liquidity
	- Historical Data - Based on a time window
	- Market Analytics - Intra-day, symbol-specific information:
		- Bid/Ask Imbalances

		- Execution Price Momentum
	- Order Details - Size, Limit Price, Symbol, Order Type, Execution Instructions
	- Order Feedback - Real-time Parent/Child Order Information:
		- Open/Executed Child Orders
		- Hidden/Displayed Liquidity
		- Average Observed Price Execution
	- Fair Price based off of Historical data, Market Analytics, Order Feedback
	- Execution Probability - Probability of Fill at a given price level at a venue
	- Venue Characteristics:
		- Venue Type - Exchange/ATS etc.
		- Pricing Structure - Inverted, Maker/Taker
		- Supprt for Order Types/Features
	- Venue Cost - Fees/Rebates
 18.9) Accessible Venues and Execution Modes
 18.10) Order Types and Execution Modes
 18.11) Order Handling Scenarios to Consider
	- Short sell securities in price test are sent to primary exchange, unless overridden
		- Market orders become limit orders with price 1 tick less aggressive than the market impact price
		- Market Impact Price => More restrictive of either Limit Up/Down price and erroneous price
	- Best price venue down - sent to default venue (e.g. BATS)
	- Orders entered prior to open - automatically set for pre-open and continuous trading
		- Continuous ends when symbol goes into closed state on the primary venue
		- If symbol not open at primary by a set time, it is treated as continuous trading
	- Orders with opening/closing TIF sent to primary
	- Symbols halted for traging are routed to primary unless overridden
	- Algorithmic venue selection failure - randomized ranking to select venues
 18.12) PATH Customization Options
	- Cross Modes
		- Disable specific venues/venue types
		- Route based on exchange cost
			- Ping disabled
			- Sweeping on price first, then venue cost
	- Ping Customization - Disable Ping

		- Minimum Execution Quantity
		- Disable initial VIPANI dip in NAGAR
 18.13) Directed Orders via PATH
	- PATH forwards limit orders without changes
	- Market orders sent at marketable limit prices - above NBO/below NBB with an internal threshold
 18.14) Exchange Market Data
	- EXEGY with SIP as a backup
 18.15) Non-exchange Market Data
	- IOI Venues
		- IOI quantity in venue ranking logic
		- Send IOC orders for sweep, which may not be honored
	- ATS Venues
		- Displayed quantity in venue ranking logic
		- Send IOC orders for sweep, which may not be honored
 18.16) Performance Evaluation of Algos
	- Average Slippage from VWAP, TWAP, arrival price
	- Evaluated across market capitalization, spread duration, order sizes
	- Order Outlier analysis
 18.17) Information Leakage Anti-gaming Protection
	- Symbol-specific Analytics
		- Volume profile, average spread, quote depth, volatility estimate
		- Dynamic Scheduling and Volume Forecasting
		- Chase Protection - Symbol-specific block exclusion for all participation tracking
		- Non-deterministic Child Order Placement
			- Release time of passive/aggressive orders does not fillow a pre-defined progression
		- Dynamic Limit Pricing for Hidden Non-displayed Orders
			- Prevents Unfavorable executions due to to short term movements
 18.18) Capital Commitment - Enabled for Child TWAP VWAP POV

	- Cancel any remaining Quantity to the User
 19.2) Phase-based Conditional Action
	- Phases markers are: Continuous Start and Continuous End
 19.3) Additional Considerations
	- Client DAY orders become IOC
	- Amendments will cancel current wave and restart from #1
	- Current wave is completed and leaves canceled
	- IPO not wave eligible
 --------------------------

 --------------------------
 #20 - Indifference price
 --------------------------
 --------------------------
 20.1) Overview
	- Pricing Securities wrt a utility function
	- Also called reservation price or private valuation
	- Price at which the expected utility level is the same by exercising a transaction vs. not doing so (with optimal trading otherwise)
	- Produces Pricing Range - bid/ask or good-deal bounds
 20.2) Mathematics
	- V (x, k) - Supremum of the Terminal of the Expected Utility (u) value of
		- A Portfolio consisting of an initial amount x + k units of an entity (stock, option, etc.)
		- Supremum is taken over all self-financing portfolios
	- Indifference bid price is the solution to V (x - vBid (k), k) = V (x, 0)
	- Indifference bid price is the solution to V (x + vAsk (k), -k) = V (x, 0)
 20.3) Approach
	- Assume portfolio of constituent securities whose weighted market value adds up to x + v
	- Work out V(x + v, k) generically unoptimized across component weights
	- Remember when k = 0, v = 0, compute the optimal value of V(x, k = 0).
		- This is the indifference terminal value.
	- Now work out the optimal weights corresponding to V(x + v, k).
	- You now have the optimal weights in terms of v. Remember V(x + v, k) = V(x, 0). So now solve for v to get v = v(k).

	- EP: Execution Price
	- DP: Decision Price
	- Q: Quantity
	- EC: Explicit Costs, made from Broker Charges and Commission
	- (EP - DP) x Q = Also called slippage
 21.4) Participation of Volume - Total Market Volume, Participation Rate
 21.5) Iceberg - Splits large ones into small and hides the rest
 21.6) SOR - All the above across multiple venues
 21.7) SMRT - SOR + Algo-based Order Placement
 21.8) Order Scheduling - Time Window Delay for Order Placement

 #22 - Trading Strategy Algo Framework
 --------------------------
 --------------------------
 22.1) Broad Institutional Trading Platform Components
	- Algo Engine
	- FIX Translator
	- Order Validator
	- Risk Management
	- Monitoring
	- Market Data Consumer
	- Post-trade Processor
 22.2) Algo Engine
	- Purpose: Takes the client’s high-level instruction, and decides how and when to slice out child orders
		based on the current state of the market and the pre-loaded quantitative models
	- Core Functional Components
		- Algo Model Data Interface
		- Order Validation Engine
		- Child Order Slicing Interface
		- OMS Venue Interface
		- Market Data Interfacer
		- Security Master Static Data Interface
		- Algo Output Safety Bounds Checker
		- Risk Check Interface
		- Strategy Implementer (e.g., VWAP, DROP LIQUIDITY SEEKER)
		- Timer Service Interface
 22.3) The Trading Strategies (Algos)
	- VWAP - Strategy trades in line with the market volume based on a dynamic volume prediction model
	- DROP LIQUIDITY SEEKER - Hybrid liquidity seeker/impact minimization algo that balances the speed of
		execution with avoiding undue market impact as per its equivalent model, with an opportunistic
		component searching for block liquidity in parallel
	- Safety Customizations - Order must a) complete, b) exclude auctions
 22.4) Trading Logic Components
	- Algo, Scheduler, Order Task, Order Router
	- Algo:
		- Top layer that manages all upstream interactions with the user, e.g., handling new orders and
			amendments, and it creates and manages the Scheduler and the Order Task
		- Responsible for slicing child shares to the opening and the closing auctions
	- Scheduler:
		- Paces the order over the duration using the various quantitative models and the trading logic
		- Pre-trade Scheduler: Suggests the total number of shares to trade over the duration of the order.
		- Impact Minimization Scheduler: Pace at which the Algo should trade at any given time. This is used
			for DROP LIQUIDITY SEEKER orders
		- VWAP Scheduler: Predicts the amount of volume throughout the day and at the auctions based on what
			has happened historically and intra-day so far
	- Order Task and Order Router:
		- Order Task: Manages and deploys three layers of intra-day trading tactics, i.e., routers, and
			shuffles between them as dictated by the Algo
		- Order Router: Router can also stitch together multiple sub-routers, for example a serial mid-point
			all-or-none router + a spread crossing order to the IEX router
		- POST – Passively adding liquidity
			- Starts with a 2:1 split-post on the near-side between IEX D-Limit and the primary exchange
			- Proportionately reshuffles between two legs based on where it gets filled, and re-pegs to the
				inside roughly every 30-60 seconds if the stock drifts away
		- TAKE – immediately removing liquidity
			- First serially pings a handful of dark-pools using all-or-none IOCs, and if that fails, it
				crosses the spread to remove liquidity using the IEX router
		- OPPO – opportunistically seeking block liquidity
			- Searches for block liquidity by split-posting mid-point orders across several dark pools and
				exchanges using a high minimum quantity, generally in the thousands of shares. This may be
				supplemented with other order types such as conditionals
 22.5) Order Lifecyle:
	- Order Arrival:
		- Receipt of a valid order, Algo subscribes to market data and then creates the Scheduler
		- For a VWAP order, the Algo creates VWAP scheduler; for a DROP LIQUIDITY SEEKER order, it creates an
			Impact Minimization Scheduler
		- Then, the Algo registers with the Algo Engine for various wakeup callbacks; at the start time,
			shortly before auction cutoff times, at the cleanup time, i.e., shortly before the end, and at
			the end time
	- Order Wakeups:
		- Upon a Pre-auction Wakeup, the Algo slices shares to the primary auction
		- At the Start Time, the Algo creates the worker and begins the first interval – the Interval logic
		- Upon the Cleanup wakeup, the Algo tells the Worker to complete any remaining scheduled shares
		- Upon the End Time Wakeup, the Algo cancels any outstanding orders and then provides an out to the
			user
	- Order Intervals:
		- Life of an order as a series of distinct 5-10 “intervals”
		- Scheduler Input #1 - Interval Length
			- Length of the interval is used to request a wakeup at the end
			- Interval length depend on other factors too like the time of the day – intervals are stretched
				longer in the morning when spreads are wider, and compressed as the day progresses
			- Additionally, smaller orders have longer intervals and vice versa. All interval durations are
				randomized
		- Scheduler Input #2 - Number of Shares Scheduled
			- VWAP Scheduler uses the dynamic volume prediction model to predict what percentage of the day’s
				volume will have traded by the end of the current interval
			- Impact Minimization Scheduler gets this value by running a dynamic programming cycle of the
				impact minimization model
			- Algo then uses this information to tell the Order Task to complete any shares outstanding from
				previous interval and start working a new interval quantity
			- Additionally, the Algo requests “catch up” wakeups throughout the interval where it checks if
				the Order Task is falling behind, and if so, tells it to cross the spread to keep up pace
			- Throughout the life of a DROP LIQUIDITY SEEKER order, the Algo tells the Order Task to search
				for block liquidity at the mid-point with all remaining unscheduled shares using an
				Opportunistic router
	- Order Amendment:
		- Upon receipt of a client replace request, the Algo generally cancels or amends the Order Task to
			comply with the new instructions
		- Algo also creates a new Scheduler to use from this point forward
 22.6) Trading Objectives/Design Process
	- Low Level:
		- Objective #1 - Avoiding Adverse Selection
			- Prop Firm Perspective - When the market transitions to a new price level, there is a flood of
				trading activity where the fastest proprietary firms race to pick off the resting orders at
				the old price level and establish queue position at the new price level – these are two
				similar but different strategies
			- Sell-side Perspective - As a sell-side firm, it is not plausible to effectively compete in
				these races, so the only viable way to prevent adverse selection is to utilize built-in
				protections available in trading venues, such as IEX D-Peg and D-Limit, and NASDAQ MELO
		- Objective #2 - Removing Liquidity
			- Algo starts off by using the IEX Router when crossing the spread
			- Dark pools are checked using the all-or-none mid-point order prior to crossing the spread
	- High Level:
		- Objective: Optimize Factors that determine how the Algo should spread out trading throughout the
			day
		- Factor #1: How does one measure success at a high level? Using Distilled Impact
		- Factor #2: How much volume does one expect to trade during the life of the order? Volume Prediction
			Model
		- Factor #3: How much should the Algo be willing to trade during the life of the order? Pre-trade
			Model
		- Factor #4: How should one pace the trading activity throughout the life of the order? Impact
			Minimization Model

 #23 - Volume-Weighted Average Approach
 --------------------------
 --------------------------
 23.1) General Hstorical Market Symbol Cumulative Volume to Time t vs. Realized Symbol Volume at Time t
	- Of course, and their VWAP
 23.2) Problem Formulation
	- Daily Time Interval (09:30 to 16:00) divv'ied into delta t = 10 minute intervals
	- Opening Auction Volume is up to 09:30
	- Closing Auction Volume is after 16:00 (say 16:10)
	- Historical Time-wise Average Volume V_hist and Traded Percentage X_hist (based on rolling delta d = 20 day average)
	- Historical Time-wise 20 day ADV
	- Realized Time-wise Average Volume V_realized and Traded Percentage X_realized
	- Decision to catch up or wait or do nothing
		- If catch up, how much
		- It wait, how long
		- Do nothing - if the catch up market impact is too high
	- Volume Prediction mismatch Metric
		- |Historical(t) - Realized(t)| Integrand
 23.3) Estimation of Predicted Volume Fraction R(t)
	- ADV Normalized Trading Volume A(t) = V(t)/ADV
	- Observations Grouped by V_hist(t) and A(t)
	- Predicted Volume Fraction R(t) is the average of X_hist(t) across a single grouping of V_hist(t) and A(t)
 23.4) Partial Trading Days
	- Need estimates for volume fraction start and volume fraction end times
	- Smooth, monotonic interpolation
