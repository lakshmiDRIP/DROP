 #3 - Bellman Equation
 --------------------------
 --------------------------
 3.1) Derivation
	- A Dynamic Decision Problem
		- Infinite-horizon Decision Problem: V(x_0) = Max across all a_t Sum over t (MDF^t . Payoff(x_t, a_t))
		- Constraints:
			- Action choice set a_t in {Action Set (x_t)}
			- Next state = T(x_t, a_t)
	- Bellman's Principle of Optimality
		- Infinite-horizon Decision Problem: V(x_0) = Max across all a_0 (Payoff(x_0, a_0) + Sum over t not t_0 MDF . (MDF^(t-1) . Payoff(x_t, a_t)))
		- Eventual Constraints:
			- Action choice set a_t in {Action Set (x_t)}
			- Next state = T(x_t, a_t)
		- Initial Constraints:
			- Action choice set a_0 in {Action Set (x_0)}
			- Next state = T(x_0, a_0)
	- The Bellman Equation
		- Infinite-horizon Decision Problem: V(x_0) = Max across all a_0 (Payoff(x_0, a_0) + MDF . V(x_1)
		- Eventual Constraints:
			- Action choice set a_t in {Action Set (x_t)}
			- Next state = T(x_t, a_t)
		- Initial Constraints:
			- Action choice set a_0 in {Action Set (x_0)}
			- Next state = T(x_0, a_0)
		- Generalized Form: V(x_0) = Max across all a_t in {Action Set (x_t)} (Payoff(x_t, a_t) + MDF . V(T(x_t, a_t))
	- In a Stochastic Problem
		- Infinite-horizon Decision Problem: V(c_0) = Max across all a_t Sum over t (MDF^t . Payoff(c_t, a_t))
			- Current Endowment is a_t - Initial is a_0
			- State is Consumption c_t
			- MDF = 1 / (1 + r) => r being the Stochastic Interest Rate
		- a_(t+1) = (1 + r).(a_t - c_t)
		- Stochastic Interest Rate implies that V(x) will be a quadrature over the future interest rate paths
			- Quadrature Measure Q over the filtration adapted over the realized interest rate trajectory
		- Stochastic Sequential Optimization Problem - Ex-post over stochastic path evolution
			- V(x, z) = max over {Action choice set a in {Action Set (x)}} {Payoff(x, a, z) + MDF.Integral over z' {V(T(x, a), z')}}

 #4 - Understanding Exact Dynamic Programming through Bellman Operators
 --------------------------
 --------------------------
 4.1) Value Functions as Vectors
	- State space made up of n R^1 states s_1 through s_n
	- Action space made up of m actions a_1 through a_m
	- Stochastic Action Policy (probability of action a at state s)
		- Deterministic Action Policy: Policy at state s is a
	- Value Function v as function of policy pi given a starting state s => v_pi(s)
	- Optimal Value Function v_*(s) = max over pi v_pi(s)
 4.2) Reward and Probabilities
	- R_(s, a) => Expected Reward on action a in state s
	- P_(s, s', a) => Probability of Transition s -> s' on action a
	- R_pi(s) = sum over a pi (a given s).R_(s, a)
	- P_pi(s, s') = sum over a pi (a given s).P_(s, s', a)
	- Gamma - MDP Discount Factor
 4.3) Bellman Operators B_pi and B_star
	- Bellman Policy Operator B_pi: B_pi(v) = R_pi + Gamma.B_pi(v)
		- B_pi is a linear operator with a fixed point v_pi
	- Bellman Optimality Operator B_pi: B_star(v)(s) = max over a {R_(s, a) + Gamma.sum over (s' element of S) [P_(s, s', a)(v)(s')]}
		- B_pi is a non-linear operator with a fixed point v_pi
	- Deterministic Greedy Policy G(v): G(v)(s) = arg max of a {R_(s, a) + Gamma.sum over (s' element of S) [P_(s, s', a)(v)(s')]}
		- B_G(v).v = B_star.v
 4.4) Contraction and Monotonicity of Operators
	- B_pi and B_star are gamma contraction under L_infinity norm, i.e.,
		- ||B_pi(v1) - B_pi(v2)||_infinity <= gamma.||v1 - v2||_infinity
		- ||B_star(v1) - B_pi(star)||_infinity <= gamma.||v1 - v2||_infinity
	- B_pi and B_star are monotonic, i.e.,
		- v1 <= v2 => B_pi(v1) <= B_pi(v2)
		- v1 <= v2 => B_star(v1) <= B_star(v2)
 4.5) Policy Evaluation
	- Bellman Expectation Equation => B_pi(v_pi) = v_pi
	- Policy Evaluation Algorithm => Repeatedly applying B_pi on v => lim (N -> Infinity) B_pi (Iteration N) (v) = v_pi

 7.1) RFQ vs. Order Book
 --------------------------

 --------------------------
 #8 - How storing Supply and Demand affects Price Diffusion
 --------------------------
 --------------------------
 8.1) Market Order - Arrives in chunks of σ shares at μ shares per unit time
	- Equal probability for buy and sell orders
	- Size distibution with standard deviation √(2/π) σ
 8.2) Limit Order - Arrives in chunks of σ shares at α shares per unit price per unit time
 8.3) Limit Offers placed at a uniform probability at integer multiples of a tick size p_0 in the range b(t)<p<∞ and for bids on -∞<p<a(t)
 8.4) Explicit Limit Order Removal Rate: Constant probability δ per unit time
 8.5) Depth profile N(p,t): Density of shares in the order book at price p and time t
	- Positive for bids and negative for offers
	- Depth of bids/offers using price coordinates centered at the midpoint m(t) so that b(t)≡-a(t)
 8.6) π(N,p,t) => Probability that an interval dp centered around price p has N shares at time t
	- P_+ (∆p,t) be the probability that m(t) increases by ∆p
	- P_- (∆p,t) be the probability that it decreases by ∆p
 8.7) Ignoring Joint Event Occurrence: α, Nδ, P_+, and P_- small so that higher order terms corresponding to simultaneous events are neglected
 8.8) General Master Equation for π
	- ∂π(N,p)/∂t=
		α(p)dp/σ [π(N-σ,p)-π(N,p)]+
		δ/σ [(N+σ)π(N+σ,p)-Nπ(N,p)]+
		μ(p)/2σ [π(N+σ,p)-π(N,p)]+
		∑_∆p▒〖P_+ (∆p)[π(N,p-∆p)-π(N,p)] 〗+
		∑_∆p▒〖P_- (∆p)[π(N,p+∆p)-π(N,p)] 〗
 8.9) Component Contributions to Master Density:
	- α term to receipt of a limit order
	- δ term to spontaneous removal of a limit order
	- μ term to the receipt of the market order
	- P_+ term to an increase in the midpoint m(t)→m(t)+∆p
	- P_- term to a decrease m(t)→m(t)-∆p
 8.10) Co-moving Reference Frame for Mid-price Diffusion:
	- Last two terms imply a diffusion for the depth when viewed in the co-moving reference of price coordinate when the midpoint moves
 8.11) Definition of the Best Offer: π(N,p)=0 for p<0
 8.12) Mean-field Solution:
	- Approximate solution to master equation is found by:
		- Relating P_+ (∆p) and P_- (∆p) self-consistently to mean-functional forms α(p) and μ(p) for which α and μ furnish boundary conditions
	- Steady-state mean value 〈N(p)〉 obtained from the generating functional for the moments of π
	- Simulation matches the leading order properties mean-field solution
 8.13) Market Impact:
	- Definition ∆p=ϕ(ω,τ,t)
	- Intuitive expectation for convex impact
	- Origin of the Concave Impact
		- Instantaneous Price Impact - ϕ(ω,0,t)
		- Average depth 〈N(p)〉 approximated as a smooth function that vanishes at the midpoint
		- Taylor Expansion for Average Depth 〈N(p)〉≈2λp - time varying liquidity λ(t)
		- Walking the Order Book Depth:
			- Price shift caused by a market order ω>0 approximated by ω=∫_0^Δp▒N(p,t)dp
		- Linear Approximation over Time Averages 〈∆p(ω)〉=〈√(ω/λ(t) )〉
 8.14) Scaling using Flow Quantities:
	- Ignoring the effects caused by finite bin size p_0 and finite order size σ
	- Fundamental dimensional quantities are shares, price, and time
	- Non-dimensional Spread is μ/σ
	- Non-dimensional Asymptotic Depth is α/δ
	- Non dimensional Liquidity α^2/μδ
	- Non-dimensional Volatility (δμ^2)/σ^2 Derived as:
		- Square 〈∆p(ω)〉=〈√(ω/λ(t) )〉
		- Substitute ω=μ and λ=σ^2/μδ
		- Diffusion Rate: Slope of V[m(t+τ)-m(t)] vs. τ
		- Multiple Diffusion Timescales - Short Term vs Long Term
 8.15) Scaling using Flow + Granularity Quantities:
	- Fundamental Discreteness Dimensional Quantities: σ, which has the dimensions of shares, and p_0, which has the dimensions of price
	- Non-dimensional Order Granularity and Tick σ ̂=σδ/μ
	- Non-dimensional tick p ̂=(p_0 α)/μ
	- Well-defined continuum limit with respect to the non-dimensional tick (p_0 α)/μ
	- No non-dimensional granularity parameter σδ/μ, i.e., does not affect the slope, spread, or asymptotic depth, but affects price diffusion
	- Granularity Dependence on Diffusion
		- Product of the continuum diffusion rate (δμ^2)/σ^2  and a τ-dependent power of the non-dimensional granularity parameter δσ/μ
		- Power is -1/2 for short term diffusion and 1/2 for long-term diffusion
	- Weak autocorrelations in price differences m(t)-m(t-1) that persist for timescales until the variance vs τ becomes a straight line
		- Timescale depends on the parameters, but typically 50
		- Temporal Market-Impact Coefficient: 〈∆p〉=〈ϕ(ω,τ)〉=f(τ) √ω
			- f(τ) decreases from its initial value, reaching a non-zero asymptotic f(∞)

 --------------------------
 --------------------------
 9.1) Overview of the Model Predictions – Varying the Granularity Parameter ϵ
	- Limit of ε_p→0
	- Large ϵ: ϵ≳0.01
		- Large accumulation of the orders near best bid and the best ask
		- Nearly linear market impact
		- Equal short- and long-term diffusion
		- Regime where the mean-field approximation used works best
	- Medium ϵ: ϵ∼0.01
		- Accumulation of orders at the best bid and the best ask is small
		- Near the midpoint the depth profile increases linearly with price
		- Approximation: Price increases roughly as square root of the order size
	- Small ϵ: ϵ≲0.001
		- Accumulation of orders at the best bid and the best ask is very small
		- Near the midpoint the depth profile is a convex function of the price
		- Price impact is very concave
		- Short-term price diffusion rate is much smaller than the long-term price diffusion rate
 9.2) Overview of the Model Predictions – Varying the Granularity Parameter ϵ; Depth Profile
	- Dimensonless Depth Profile: n ̂=(np_c)/N_c =nδ/α
	- Cumulative Depth Profile: N(p,t)=∑_(p ̃=0)^p▒〖n(p ̃,t) ε_p 〗
	- Dimensonless Cumulative Depth Profile: N ̂(p)=N(p)/N_c =2δN(p)/μ=N(p)ϵ/μ
	- High ϵ Regime Depth Profile:
		- Annihilation due to market orders is low relative to δσ
		- Significant accumulation of the orders at the best ask
		- Average depth is much greater than zero at its mid-point
		- Mean depth profile is a concave function of price
	- Medium ϵ Regime Depth Profile:
		- Market order removal increases, depleting the average depth near the best ask
		- Profile is nearly linear over p/p_c ≤1
	- Low ϵ Regime Depth Profile:
		- Market order removal increases further, average depth near the ask very close to zero
		- Profile is convex over the range p/p_c ≤1
	- Standard Deviation of the Cumulative Depth:
		- Comparable to the mean depth
		- As ϵ increases, near midpoint there is a similar transition from convex to concave behavior
	- Density of executed orders decreases rapidly as a function of the distance from the midpoint
 9.3) Overview of the Model Predictions – Varying the Granularity Parameter ϵ; Liquidity for Market Orders: The Price Impact Function
	- Instantaneous Price Impact: ϕ(t,ω,τ→0)
	- Permanent Price Impact: ϕ(t,ω,τ→∞)
	- Price Impact Continuum over Depth: ω=N(p,t)=∫_0^p▒〖n(p ̃,t)dp ̃ 〗
	- Price Impact in Large ϵ Regime: n(p) is constant so price impact is roughly linear
	- Median ϵ Price Impact: Assumption that n(p) is linearly increasing and n(0)≈0 => mean price should increase roughly as √ω
	- Small ϵ Price Impact: n(0)≈0 means:
		- Price impact is highly concave, increasing much slower than √ω
		- Depth profile n(p) is convex
 9.4) Relationship of Price Impact to Cumulative Depth; Moment Expansion

 9.5) Overview of the Mode Parameters – Varying the Granularity Parameter ϵ; Spread
	- Spread Probability Density at s/p_c =0:
		- Spread probability density is substantial at s/p_c =0 which is the limit ε_p→0
	- Peak of the Spread Density: At approximately 0.2p_c
	- Spread Dependence on ϵ: Spread is very small for large ϵ, and large for small ϵ
	- Depth Fluctuations for Large ϵ:
		- For large ϵ the fluctuations around the mean depth are roughly independent
		- Probability for a market order to penetrate at a given price level is:
			- Probability that all the ticks smaller than the price level contain no orders, which gives rise to an exponential decay
	- Behavior for Small ϵ:
		- For small ϵ, the probability distribution of the spread becomes insensitive to ϵ
	- Mean Spread increases with ϵ

	- Characteristic Step for Random Walk: μ/2α
	- Characteristic Time for Random Walk: 1/δ
	- Diffusion Rate from Order Flow: (μ^2 δ)/α^2

		- Faster diffusion rate for short timescales
		- Slower diffusion rate for long timescales
 9.7) Overview of the Mode Parameters – Varying the Granularity Parameter ϵ; Liquidity for Limit Orders: Probability and Time-to-Fill
	- Liquidity for Limit Orders: Depends on the probability that they will be filled, and the time to be filled
		- Limit orders close to transaction prices filled more quickly
	- Limit Order Fill Probability: Decreases with ϵ
		- High ϵ - This is less than 1 even for negative prices - even for sells close best bid, significant chance that the offer is deleted before execution
			- Not true for Low ϵ
		- Fill Probability ϵ Crossover: Around p=p_c, after which the above low/high ϵ probability of fill reverses
 9.8) Overview of the Mode Parameters – Varying the Tick Size ε_p/p_c

		- p(0,t)≡a(t)
		- p(-1,t)≡b(t)

		- Stationary Distributions in Comoving Frames
	- Centered Configurations:
		- Bid-centered configuration: n_b (p,t)=n(p-b(t),t)
		- Mid-centered configuration: n_m (p,t)=n(p-m(t),t)
	- Mid-centered Ask: s(t)/2
	- Bid centered Balance Constraint => μ/2=∑_(b+ε_p)^∞▒[α-δ〈n_b (p)〉] 
	- Mid centered Balance Constraint => μ/2=α 〈s〉/2+∑_(b+ε_p)^∞▒[α-δ〈n_m (p)〉]  
	- Bid-centered Ask: α〈m-b〉=α〈s〉/2

	- Explicit Relation for Spread Probability: P[s/2<p]=1-e^(-∑_(p^'=b+ε_p)^(b+ε_p)▒〈n_m (p^' )〉 )
	- Validity at High ϵ: Mean-density profile at the midpoint 〈n_m (0)〉≲1 and strongly concave demand
		- Approximation of independent fluctuations is excellent
	- Validity at Intermediate ϵ: 〈n_m (0)〉≪1 and nearly linear, and the approximation of independence is marginal

		- Probabilities may be defined for any density n(p,t) independently at each p => Mid-centering for n(p,t)
		- Separation intervals x(N,t) independently at each N => x(N,t) is well-defined without reference to any frame
 9.13) Master Equations and Mean Field Approximations – A Number Density Equation

		- Assumption Valid Outside the Spread, not Inside
			- Rigorous Inside-Spread Density Handling: Require replacing the product with a sum of products conditioned on states of the order book
	- α(p) in a Bid-centered Frame: α(p) takes a fixed value α(∞) at all p
	- α(p) in Mid-centered Frame: Depositions below the midpoint causes shifts that deposit orders above the midpoint
	- μ(p) in Mid-centered Frame: Rate of market orders surviving to cancel limit orders at p
	- Price Range of μ(p) Values: μ(0)/2 to 0 at p→∞
	- Time Parameters for the Simulation: α(∞) and μ(0) are, thus, the parameters α and μ of the simulation
