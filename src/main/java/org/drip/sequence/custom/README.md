DROP Sequence Custom Package implements the Glivenko Cantelli Supremum Deviation Bounds.


## Class Components

 * [***BinPacking***](https://github.com/lakshmiDRIP/DROP/tree/master/src/main/java/org/drip/sequence/custom/BinPacking.java)
 <i>BinPacking</i> contains Variance Bounds of the critical measures of the standard operations research bin
 packing problem.

 * [***GlivenkoCantelliFunctionSupremum***](https://github.com/lakshmiDRIP/DROP/tree/master/src/main/java/org/drip/sequence/custom/GlivenkoCantelliFunctionSupremum.java)
 <i>GlivenkoCantelliFunctionSupremum</i> contains the Implementation of the Supremum Class Objective Function
 dependent on Multivariate Random Variables where the Multivariate Function is a Linear Combination of
 Bounded Univariate Functions acting on each Random Variate.

 * [***GlivenkoCantelliUniformDeviation***](https://github.com/lakshmiDRIP/DROP/tree/master/src/main/java/org/drip/sequence/custom/GlivenkoCantelliUniformDeviation.java)
 <i>GlivenkoCantelliUniformDeviation</i> contains the Implementation of the Bounded Objective Function
 dependent on Multivariate Random Variables where the Multivariate Function is a Linear Combination of
 Bounded Univariate Functions acting on each Random Variate.

 * [***KernelDensityEstimationL1***](https://github.com/lakshmiDRIP/DROP/tree/master/src/main/java/org/drip/sequence/custom/KernelDensityEstimationL1.java)
 <i>KernelDensityEstimationL1</i> implements the L1 Error Scheme Estimation for a Multivariate Kernel Density
 Estimator with Focus on establishing targeted Variate-Specific and Agnostic Bounds.

 * [***LongestCommonSubsequence***](https://github.com/lakshmiDRIP/DROP/tree/master/src/main/java/org/drip/sequence/custom/LongestCommonSubsequence.java)
 <i>LongestCommonSubsequence</i> contains Variance Bounds on the Critical Measures of the Longest Common
 Subsequence between two Strings.

 * [***OrientedPercolationFirstPassage***](https://github.com/lakshmiDRIP/DROP/tree/master/src/main/java/org/drip/sequence/custom/OrientedPercolationFirstPassage.java)
 <i>OrientedPercolationFirstPassage</i> contains Variance Bounds on the Critical Measures of the Standard
 Problem of First Passage Time in Oriented Percolation.
