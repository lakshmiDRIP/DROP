/**
 * <i>BasisBSplineSet</i> implements Samples for the Construction and the usage of various basis spline
 * 	functions. It demonstrates the following:
 * 	- Construction of segment control parameters - polynomial (regular/Bernstein) segment control,
 * 		exponential/hyperbolic tension segment control, Kaklis-Pandelis tension segment control, and C1
 * 		Hermite.
 * 	- Control the segment using the rational shape controller, and the appropriate Ck.
 * 	- Estimate the node value and the node value Jacobian with the segment, as well as at the boundaries.
 * 	- Calculate the segment monotonicity.
